            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Pretended Parliament of <hi>England</hi> having their Agents la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely in the <hi>Low Countryes,</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the <hi>United Provinces</hi> about conditions of an offenſive and defenſive war, my reſolution was to have ſet out this Remonſtrance in the <hi>Dutch tongue</hi> for the ſatisfaction of thoſe <hi>Provinces:</hi> but the treaty ended almoſt as ſoone as I began to actuate my reſolution; whereupon I altered my purpoſe, and have now ſet it out in <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of your own Subjects, hoping the truth
<pb facs="tcp:132567:3"/>being here clearly illuſtrated, may have ſome effect upon their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> which cannot but have great ſway over them in ordering and directing their Actions. Experience teacheth that moſt men act leſſe boldly and reſolutley, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially where their lives muſt be engaged) when they act againſt their <hi>Conſcience,</hi> then when they are perſwaded of the lawfullneſſe and juſtice of their cauſe. There hath been more blood ſpilt by civill war in your <hi>Majeſties</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions within the ſpace of ten years, ſince thoſe pernicious <hi>principles</hi> touching the <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the People</hi> and <hi>lawfulneſſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance</hi> have been inſtilled into mens mindes by ſome who fetched their doctrine from Hell to furniſh the world with tragedies, then formerly in an Hundred. I conceive the neareſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt way to reform ſuch un-chriſtian practiſes, is to reform the <hi>Conſcience;</hi> although I deny not but more ſharp and violent remedies muſt alſo be applyed: for ſome have lost all ſenſe of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> whom your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> I hope, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the almighty providence of God, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb facs="tcp:132567:3"/>by the <hi>Sword.</hi> This is that which Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on calls for at your hands, now oppreſſed by ſuch a multitude, and confuſed ſwarm of <hi>Sect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries,</hi> that I ſhould think it impoſſible for ſo many men of ſeverall Religions to live together in unitie, did not the <hi>Likeneſſe</hi> of their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> reconcile their affections, as much as their differences in Religion can alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and eſtrange them. And this is that which all your faithfull Subjects pray for, who deſire nothing more in this world then to ſee your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> ſeated in your <hi>Royall Throne,</hi> and able to protect them from the inſolencies of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, who make their will their law, diſpoſing as freely of mens lives and fortunes, as if they had <hi>created</hi> them and given them their <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a rule in <hi>Opticks,</hi> when a dark body is greater then a light to which it is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it caſteth a ſhadow <hi>in infinitum:</hi> Such a ſhadow (if the continent were capable of an infinite ſhadow) will the dark body of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells caſt upon the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> whilſt
<pb facs="tcp:132567:4"/>it is interpoſed between your <hi>Majeſty</hi> and your loyall Subjects, depriving them both of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable <hi>Aſpect,</hi> and of your <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> without which they can look for nothing but a continuation of their preſent miſeries: for ſhould the Rebells prevaile and proſper in their deſignes, what elſe can be expected, but that which is wreſted from others by <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,</hi> ſhould be maintained by <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice?</hi> But whilſt they wade in <hi>blood</hi> to places of preferment and command, the Lord ſhall overthrew them in the middeſt of their courſe, as he overthrew the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in the <hi>Red-ſea;</hi> I uſurp not the name of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> but I ſpeak as one believing God to be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obſerver of his promiſes: He will not always be deafe to the prayers and complaints of thoſe that are oppreſſed, but ſend them diliverance in his due time, and ſupply your <hi>Majeſty</hi> with all things neceſſary both to vindicate your own Rights, and free your People from their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>

               </hi> Look upon the government of <hi>England,</hi> if the Laws might be reſtored to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient dignity and authority, as inferiour to none in the world. Parliaments, whilſt the King and Parliament have acted in their ſeveral ſpheres, &amp; not invaded the rights and priviledges of one another, have alwayes been the ſureſt means under God to unite their affections together, and to prevent thoſe dangers which by their mutual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord muſt of neceſsity have ruined both. Some are ſo raſh as to affirm, that all <hi>Tranſactions, Negotiations,</hi> and <hi>accords</hi> between Kings and Subjects ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted; not onely depriving ſubjects of the light and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:132567:6"/>favours which they ſhould receive from their Prince, but Princes alſo of many commodities which they may receive by capitulating with their ſubjects in Parliaments, where the whole kingdome being preſent, either in perſon or by repreſentation, may give the King, and receive from him again, ſuch reciprocal teſtimonies of love, that he may be aſſured his people ſeek nothing more then the preſervation of his life, honour, and Royal dignity; and they, that their King endeavoureth no leſs to encreaſe and maintain the liberty, riches, and proſperity of his people And I am confident the laſt Parliament had been as great as bleſſing to the land as ever any was in former ages, had not the ambition, avarice, and malice of ſome interrupted the courſe of the lawes. But for this aſſembly of Traitors which hath a long time called themſelves a Parliament, (ſitting without the houſe of Lords, and ſecluding from the houſe of Commons, all that would not be as cruel, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and wicked as themſelves) it is a diſturber of the Kingdoms peace, an enemy and deſtroyer of the people; and if we look upon their actions in their beginning, in their raiſe, and in their progreſs, they may ſeem to have had alwayes a formal oppoſition to juſtice, and to have acted by ſome occult and ſpecifical quality not common to other Chriſtians. There was indeed at the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Parliament, much murmuring and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent amongſt the people, partly cauſed by the monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and unuſual taxation of Ship-mony, and partly occaſioned by the abuſes of divers Courts. Here the enemies of the Common-wealth finding a ſpacious over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to enter into this Rebellion, began to act their parts, and being too provident to looſe ſuch an advantage, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:132567:6"/>to exaſperate the minds of the people, and to ſtir up thoſe evil humours which began already to appear. And although his Majeſty offered all juſt ſatisfaction for what was paſt, and the beſt ſecuritie themſelves ſhould in reaſon require that the like Diſorders might for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be prevented, yet theſe turbulent and factious ſpirits, being for the moſt part men of broken fortune, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to heal themſelves by the ruin of others, oppoſed all ſuch motions, and would needs themſelves become <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions</hi> to the ſtate; and as <hi>Chyrurgions</hi> are wont to <hi>ſmooth</hi> and <hi>ſtroak</hi> the parts which they reſolve ſhall bleed, ſo they began to <hi>ſmooth</hi> and <hi>ſtroak</hi> the people, promiſing them a new light in matters of Religion, and that they would remove the grievances, and ſweeten the evils which affected the Common wealth: although in ſtead of removing and ſweetning them, they have almoſt made them incurable. By theſe perſwaſions mixed with many pretences of Religion they procured the people to meet together in great multitudes, and in a tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner to aſſault divers of the Lords as they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Parliament, and to drive them back again, not permitting them to ſpeak in the houſe when their ſpeech was moſt neceſſary for the ſervice of the Kingdome. Although it was eaſy for his Majeſty to diſcover their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, yet the love he bare his people made him to diſſemble it, and to give way to their proceedings, hoping they might in time be brought by his favours to mitigate and correct their furious practiſes; but finding at laſt that his patience ſerved for nothing elſe but to fortifie and encourage them in their malice, he thought himſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to take ſuch wayes as he judged moſt convenient to ſtop the courſe of their proceedings, the continuation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:132567:7"/>whereof was like to bring ſo many miſchiefs to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: and ſeeing it was like to be prejudicial to the ſafety of the people as well as to his own to ſtay lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in a place where there was neither ſecurity for his perſon, nor liberty for any other then thoſe factious perſons to vote according to the dictats of their own reaſon, he was forced to withdraw himſelf from the Parliament to avoid the pernicious effects of thoſe mens counſels which were reſolved the whole commonwealth ſhould ſink rather then themſelves not obtain thoſe places of command and profit which they aimed at. The King being gone it was not to be wondred if they which in his preſence had the boldneſs to weave ſuch pernicious deſignes againſt the ſtate, ſhould in his abſence endevour to corrupt the fidelity of his ſubjects, for having the city of <hi>London</hi> wholy at their command, they neither wanted means nor opportunity to draw the people to their faction, who by ſuch artificial devices as they uſed were eaſie to be inſnared: They tould them that by reſiſting the King, they ſhould not be rebels, but an army authoriſed by thoſe which were <hi>depoſitaries</hi> of the Kings authority; that this reſiſtance was an <hi>inſpiration</hi> from heaven which promiſed the reſtauration of their ancient liberties which, they ſaid, had been ſo often violated by the King: They made them believe that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the King, and the whole commonwealth, would be brought into confuſion if they did not vigourouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe diſorders were growing upon them, and remove thoſe evill counſellors from the King that did miſlead and ſeduce him; and withall they ſet out a Declaration pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to preſerve and defend the Kings Majeſties perſon and authority together with the liberties of the Kingdom, aſſuring them they had no thoughts or intentions to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:132567:7"/>his Majeſties juſt power and greatneſs, or any way to alter the conſtitution of the government, or of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments conſiſting of a King, a houſe of Lords, and a houſe of Commons. But now we ſee the effects contrary to thoſe words and promiſes which were ſo ſolemnly made to the whole Kingdome: for they have not onely diminiſhed his Majeſties juſt power and greatneſs, overthrown the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and very being of Parliaments, but moſt traiterouſly deprived his Majeſty of his life, and that afte he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended ſo far as to ſatifie all their unreaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: which fact of theirs although it hath been masked with many ſpecious pretences, and coloured with the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhews of juſtice; yet was it the moſt execrable murder that ever was committed next that of our Saviour Chriſt: and his ambitious judge hath gained this, that next PILATE, BRADSHAW of all ſuch judges ſhall by poſterity be eſteemed the chief. This murder of the King as it was moſt unjuſt, ſo was it alſo moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable conſidering the preſent diſpoſition of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whoſe ſtrength being already too much weakened and attenuated, ought not to have been further waſted and conſumed by renewing the war, which the death of the King did threaten. But ſuch motions could work nothing upon thoſe which had long before reſolved to make all other conſiderations give place to profit and ambition: the people abuſed themſelves whilſt they thought this factious aſſembly would be more careful and tender of them then of the King: for they have not onely brought a new war upon them which might have been avoided, daſhing them all againſt one another, but have alſo themſelves many wayes barbarouſly afflicted and deſtroyed them: they have made the <hi>ſcaffold</hi> the <hi>Gibbet,</hi> the <hi>priſon,</hi> and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:132567:8"/>
               <hi>grave,</hi> the common places of their <hi>rendezvous;</hi> and thoſe which they have not devoured by their cruelty, they devour by their unſatiable avarice; whilſt they declaim againſt Kings for oppreſſing the people by unjuſt taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they have themſelves, as hath been computed by many, ſqueeſed more in one year from the Commonwealth then all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have done ſince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. The lawful Mageſtrates are deprived of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honour of their functions; and ſuch as are the greateſt enemies to juſtice are ſet up in their places; ſome are bereft of their eſtates, others are driven out of the Kingdome and forced to ſeek a forraign ayre, where they may breath more freely then in their own: The whole <hi>Nobility, Clergy,</hi> &amp; <hi>Commonalty</hi> walk deſolately &amp; mournfully up and down, being no more like the men they were, then the skinnes of ſacrificed beaſts are like their living bodies. And after all theſe indignities offered to the King and people, they endevour contrary to the lawes to alter the government and to pull up the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kingdome, calling their new frame and ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture a <hi>Free Eſtate,</hi> and themſelves the keepers of the freedome of <hi>England:</hi> Thus having guilt over this Idol of their own fancy, they force all men to fall down and worſhip it; they whoſe vertue oblige them to refuſe; are caſt into a <hi>furnace</hi> hotter then that of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing the body of the Kingdome devoured thus to the very entrails, I could not withont horrour behold ſuch a miſerable carkaſſe ſo rent and torn in every part, nor could I ſatisfie mine own conſcience if I ſhould not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour according to my poor abilities to oppoſe the rage and ſury of theſe men which are grown ſo <hi>fat</hi> with the <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>ſpoile</hi> of others: My intention therefore is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:132567:8"/>reſerving matters of fact to ſpeak here of matters of right, and to ſhew the injuſtice of their cauſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the falſhood of all thoſe Principles whereby they endevour to juſtifie their proceedings; not doubting but I ſhall ſo far convince the underſtanding of all thoſe that ſhall read this inſuing diſcourſe, that they ſhall not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after enter into any combination with the rebels, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with them in them in caſe they be already engaged, except their hearts be hardened ſo far, as they dare act in matters of ſuch concernment contrary to their conſciences.</p>
            <p>The Principles and grounds whereby they endevour to juſtifie this preſent war againſt the King are two; Firſt they ſay that it is lawful for the people to reſiſt their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and ſupreme governours by force of arms in caſe they be Tyrants, and bent to ſubvert the laws and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion eſtabliſhed, or by illegal proceedings invade the lives, eſtates, or liberties of their ſubjects. But there is ſome diſagreement amongſt them in the reſtriction and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Principle; for ſome give free ſcope and liberty to all private perſons to reſiſt, and with their ſwords in their hands to defend their lives and eſtates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the unjuſt invaſion of all Kings and governours whatſoever. Others do a little ſtint the people and limit the bounds of reſiſtence, permitting none to have that power but ſubordinate Magiſtrates, or the people colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively taken and their ſubſiſtutes in Parliament. Yet theſe content themſelves with the ſame particular inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces brought by others, alledging little beſides particular examples, as the example of <hi>David</hi> who (as they ſay) would have reſiſted <hi>Saul</hi> if occaſion had been offered; The example of the Prieſts, who, (as they ſay) aſsaulted <hi>Uzziah,</hi> and ſuch like examples of particular men, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:132567:9"/>were neither the people collectively taken, nor their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes in Parliament, nor yet the greater part ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>But ſome have thought upon an other way how to make good their rebellion confeſsing the former aſſertion to tend directly to the ruine and ſubverſion of government, and to be alſo contrary to the law of God: theſe proceed upon another Principle, namely that ſupreme juriſdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the people, the King they ſay is <hi>major ſingulis</hi> but <hi>minor univerſis,</hi> greater and hath more authority then any one of his ſubjects taken by retaile, but taken in the groſs his ſubjects are greater and have more authority then he; and theſe agree altogether in this that they teach all authority to be originally in the people <hi>tanquam in primo ſubjecto creato</hi> as in the firſt ſubject imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under God, and from them tranſlated to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; Yet theſe are alſo divided amongſt themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the extent &amp; latitude of the power that may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated; for ſome of them ſay that the rights of ſoveraignity belong to the people by the law of nature, and are ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to them that they cannot be ſeperated or divided from them; they cannot be taken away by conqueſt, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not part with them by conſent, but under what form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſoever they live, by what means ſoever eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and ſet up, they have ſtill reſerved in them a ſupreme juriſdiction over all Magiſtrates, by which they are authoriſed to give a legal judgment upon all their actions, and to reſume again their whole authority when they ſhall ſee occaſion, making a circle in government, and granting a power in Magiſtrates to judge and govern the people, and alſo in the people to judge and govern their Magiſtrates. Others on the contrary ſide ſay that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:132567:9"/>the people may loſe the rights of ſoveraignty by conqueſt, or part with them by conſent, ſo that they ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to themſelves ſupreme juriſdiction over their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to judge juridically whether their actions be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal or illegal; but the people of <hi>England</hi> (they ſay) have not <hi>de facto</hi> parted with their authority in ſuch a full degree, but are ſupreme by the laws of the land, or at leaſt coordinate with the King; for at the firſt coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the government by paction and agreement made with the King they reſerved to themſelves a part in the rights of ſoveraignty which they ſtill hold by law. This is their other Principle as deſtructive to government as the former, and the authors and maintainers of them both agree well enough in their end, that is, to ſtir up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to rebellion: only they of the firſt rank would perſwade them they may lawfully do it by way of ſelf preſervation; and they of the ſecond by way of juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>I intend now by Gods aſsiſtance to examine theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Principles, and to diſcover as well the falſity of them, as the dangerous conſequences that flow from them, which I hope to perform with ſuch clearneſs, and evidence, that the moſt <hi>harc-brain'd ſectaries</hi> amongſt them ſhall be convinced, if they will but read that which ſhall be alledged againſt them.</p>
            <p>Now that I may proceed in opening and clearing the truth with the better method, I will divide the matter I am to handle into two parts; In the firſt part I will ſpeak of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and here I will ſhew that the King alone is the only ſupreme head and governour of the Kingdom of <hi>Englan</hi> and that all the people and their deputies in Parliament, as well collectively taken, as ſeverally, are his ſubjects and not coordinate with him: In the ſecond
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:132567:10"/>part I will ſpeak of <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> and there I will ſhew that the ſupreme Magiſtrates and governours of any Kingdom or Commonwealth may not by their ſubjects be reſiſted by force of armes upon pretence of tyranny or miſdemeanour, or upon any other cauſe or pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. I will begin with <hi>Supremacy,</hi> becauſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour now chiefly to purge themſelves from the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and injuſtice which they have committed by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the people, whoſe ſupremacy they ſay is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to warrant their proceedings. At the firſt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not the ſupremacy of the King, but as the keepers and guardians of it they raiſed an army againſt him by vertue of his own authority, but having ſeiſed upon his perſon and impriſoned him, it was then more conducible to their ends to avouch the ſupremacy of the people: But whoſoever have the title, they exerciſe the power them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as before they rebelled againſt the King, ſo now they murder and oppreſs the people by pretence of their own authority, which as their Deputies in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they intend to manage as long as they can finde means to defend and uphold their tyranny. Now, although this pretended Parliament are no more deputies of the people of <hi>England,</hi> then the <hi>Bantiti</hi> are deputies of the people of <hi>Italy,</hi> who if they had as great a power would ſoon have as great a right as theſe to govern under that pretence, yet for the preſent we will ſuppoſe them ſuch, and examine onely their Principle by which they labour to ſupport their cauſe, that is, the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And firſt I will ſhew that the people and their depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Parliament are neither ſupreme nor coordinate with the King by the lawes of the land, <hi>as ſome of them ſay;</hi> ſecondly, that they are not ſupreme by the laws of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:132567:10"/>nature, <hi>as others;</hi> thirdly, that the people never had in them any authority or juriſdiction at all which they could give or reſume again upon occaſion, <hi>as they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally affirm.</hi> And theſe particulars I intend to handle in three queſtions.</p>
            <p>The firſt queſtion ſhall be, Whether the people and their deputies in Parliament be ſupreme and above the King or coordinate with him by the laws of the land.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, Whether the people and their deputies in Parliament be ſupreme by the laws of nature, and have alwayes reſerved a juridical power of judging their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, whether their actions be juſt, and of reſuming authority in caſe they be not.</p>
            <p>The third, Whether authority be originally in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and tranſlated by them to Kings and other ſupreme magiſtrates; or in the Kings and other ſupreme magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates themſelves immediately from God <hi>tanquam in primo ſubjecto creato,</hi> as in the firſt created ſubject.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt Queſtion that ſhall come into conſideration is, Whether the people and their Deputies in Parliament be ſupreme and above the King or coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate with him by the Laws of the Land. The pretended Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians affirm the two Houſes to be coordinate with the King in the rights of Soveraignty; for the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> they ſay is a mixed Monarchy, and this mixture is in the power and rights of Majeſty themſelves, ſo that the King alone hath not full and plenary authority to perform all acts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to Government, but there is in the Monarchy a concurrence of ſeveral powers belonging to ſeveral eſtates,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:132567:11"/>which being mixed together make up one whole and entire power, and thoſe ſeveral eſtates one ſupreme head of the Common-wealth. And although ſome of them are ſo liberal as to allow the King a primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſhare in this coordination; yet others ſay that the ſuperiority belongs to the two Houſes, the King being greater then any one of the Members of Parliament, but leſſe then the two houſes collectively taken, who in the legiſlative power, which is one of the principal rights of Soveraignty, have a greater Intereſt then He, in whoſe breaſts alone remaineth the final determination of Law; for they deny the King to have a negative voice, as if his ſitting in Parliament were a ceremony and meer formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not an act of Majeſty and Juriſdiction. This foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, as I think, was firſt laid by the fuller Anſwerer, but the Treatiſer, the Reverend Divines, and divers others have added a ſuperſtructure to it of many fine and new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of their own, which are not needful to be here related, becauſe they alter not the ſtate of the Queſtion; for they all affirm the two Houſes to be coordinate with the King in the rights of Soveraignty, and the mixture of the Engliſh Monarchy to be in the power it ſelf. I will ſet down their aſſertions in the fuller Anſwerers own words. <hi>Before we judge,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of what a Parliament can do in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>it will be needful to know what kind of Government this of</hi> England <hi>is; we are therefore to know that</hi> England <hi>is not a ſimply ſubordinative and abſolute, but a coordinative and mixt Monarchy; this mixture or coordination is in the very ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of power it ſelf, otherwiſe the Monarchy were not mixt: all Monarchies have a mixture or compoſition of ſubordinate and under officers in them; but here the Monarchy or higheſt power it ſelf is compounded of three coordinate eſtates, a King, and two Honſes of Parliament.</hi> And again a little after, he ſaith, <hi>But you'l ſay, what? is not the Parliament ſubordinate to the King? Are they not all Subjects? I anſwer, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be ſaid properly to be a Subject, becauſe the King is a part, and ſo he ſhould be ſubject to himſelf: no, nor are the two

               <p>I ſay therefore in oppoſition to theſe phantaſies, firſt, that the King alone is by the Lawes of the Land the only Supreme head and Governour of <hi>England,</hi> and that the people and their Deputies in Parliament, taken both <hi>colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim</hi> and <hi>ſeorſim,</hi> as well <hi>collectively</hi> as <hi>ſeverally,</hi> are his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and not coordinate with him: there is no mixture at all in the rights of Soveraingty; for in reſpect of the power it ſelf, the Monarchy is abſolute, ſimple, pure, independent, without profanation of outward mixture, the King alone without further influence from the two Houſes having ful power and authority to do or cauſe to be done all acts of Juſtice. The King alone makes Laws by the aſſcent of the two Houſes, and if the two Houſes are ſaid at any time to make Lawes, it is by a delegate power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority communicated to them from him, and not by any power and authority which they have radically in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:132567:13"/>
               <p> Secondly, I ſay that the King alone is not onely inveſted with all the rights of Soveraingty, but hath them alſo ſo inſeperably annexed to hs Royal perſon by the Lawes of the Land, that they cannot be ſeparated from him by any <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> by any <hi>civil conſtitution,</hi> or <hi>pragmattical Sanction,</hi> by any <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Ordinance</hi> whatſoever; but in caſe the King himſelf ſhould improvidently by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agree to any thing tending to the diminution of his Royal Dignity, it is then in the power of the Common-law to controul ſuch a Statute, to make voyd all ſuch acts as tend to the degradation, much more ſuch as tend to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation of Majeſty. Having thus opened the ſtate of the Queſtion, I will now proceed to demonſtrate the truth by Statutes, by Common-Law, and by reaſons depending upon the laws and cuſtomes of the land.</p>

               <p>I Could both from Saxon and divers other lawes and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities ſhew the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to have ruled more abſolutely, and to have anciently exerciſed a larger Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, then hath of later years been exerciſed or chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by their Succeſſors: but becauſe many immunities and priviledges have been granted to the Subjects ſince their times; I will therefore confine my ſelf to ſuch ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes as have been made ſince the giving of the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And, to avoyd tediouſneſſe, I will omit many ſtatutes wherein the King is by both Houſes collectively taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be ſupreme: for they frequently in the ſtatutes ſtyle him, <hi>Our gracious Soveraign Lord the King.

But this is nothing elſe but the evaporation of his own brain; for if in any place the word <hi>King</hi> could ſignifie the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>two Houſes of Parliament,</hi> yet in this it muſt of neceſſity ſignifie the <hi>King</hi> alone:<note place="margin">35.

Beſides, in this Anſwer he contradicts his own Principles: for if the two Houſes be coordinate with the King, and have power radically in themſelves, not derived from him, they cannot be comprehended under his politick capacity. Whereas he ſaith <hi>the King cannot make a Law,</hi> and infer from thence that the King alone without taking in the two Houſes hath not intire and plenary juriſdiction, his inference is very infirm; for it doth not diminiſh Majeſty, but redounds to the glory of it,<note place="margin">Argum. l. 8. c. de legibus.</note> to give lawes to the people by the counſel and aſſent of wiſemen: It hath been, and is for the moſt part the practiſe in abſolute Monarchies, to make Lawes that ſhall bind poſterity by general conſent and agreement, which yet doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Monarch of his power, or derogate any way from the plenitude and intireneſſe thereof.

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Kings ſupremacy in particular ſhewed by the Statutes of the Land.</head>
               <p>THe Kings ſupremacy in general being thus confirmed by ſeveral Acts of Parliament, I will now deſcend into particulars, and ſhew his Majeſty to be legally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with all the particular rights of ſoveraignty. I will beginne with the <hi>Militia,</hi> which is a right ſo eſſential to Majeſty, that it can not, nor ought not to be ſeparated from it: For Majeſty conſiſts not in a bare and empty title, but in the rights of ſoveraignty, which he cannot be ſaid to poſſeſſe, who wants the <hi>Sword</hi> to protect the <hi>Scepter.</hi> It was confeſſed by the pretended Parliament at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of theſe diſſentions, that the <hi>Militia</hi> by right pertained to his Majeſty, and therefore at the firſt they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to have it aſſigned to them by his own aſſent; but he oppoſing their unjuſt deſires, as knowing both his own and the ruin of his poſterity would be the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch a grant, they reſolved ſeeing they could not gain it by ſurrender, to take it by aſſault, and aſſiſted by men of like natures and inclinations, they ſeiſed upon his Majeſties forts and Magazins, and have ſince exerciſed an arbitary and tyrannical power over the lives and eſtates of all that pleaſed them not, and none could ever pleaſe them, but ſuch as are of the ſame humour and diſpoſition with themſelves. I muſt confeſs I am amazed when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how confidently and deſperately they have carried on their deſigns in a caſe ſo contrary to law and juſtice; for they could not have begun a war or conteſted with his Majeſty about a matter more clear then that of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which is a right ſo inherent in the crown, ſetled upon it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:132567:18"/>by the fundamental Laws of the Land, and confirmed by ſo many ſeveral acts of Parliament, that although the pretended Parliamentarians have a great dextetity in coyning diſtinctions to elude the laws, yet they will not eaſily coyn ſuch as ſhall ſerve their turn in this particular. In the ſeventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt a Statute was made to injoyn all men to go to Parliaments, Treatiſes, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſemblies without force and armes, wherein the Kings power over the <hi>Militia</hi> is acknowledged. <hi>The King to the juſtices of his bench ſendeth greeteng. Whereas of late before certain perſons deputed to treat upon ſundry debates had between us and certain great men of our Realm, amongſt other things it was accorded that in our next Parliament after proviſion ſhall be made by us and the common aſſent of the Prelates, Earls, and Barons, that in all Parliaments, Treaties, and other Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which ſhould be made in the Realm of</hi> England <hi>for ever, that every man ſhall come without all force and armour well and peaceably to the honour of us, and the peace of us and our Realm. And now in our next Parliament at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>after the ſaid Treatiſe, the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and the Commonalty of our Realm there aſſembled to take advice of this buſineſs, have ſaid that to us it belongeth, and our part is through our Royal ſeigniory, ſtraitly to defend force of armour, and all other force againſt our peace at all times when it ſhall pleaſe us, and to puniſh them which ſhall do contrary, according to our laws and uſages of our Realm, and hereunto they are bound to aid us as their Soveraign Lord at all ſeaſons when need ſhall be. We command ye that ye cauſe theſe things to be read afore you in the ſaid bench, and there to be inrolled. Given at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>the thirtieth day of</hi> October. In another Statute made the eleventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, it is declared that all ſubjects of the Realm but eſpecially thoſe that have by the King any dignities, gifts, offices, fees, or annuities; are bound to aſſiſt the King in his wars againſt all rebellions, inſurrections and powers raiſed againſt him. And by the Parliament holden the fourth and fifth years of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> an Act was made, wherein it was acknowledged
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:132567:18"/>that the Queen and her progenitors had power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to oppoint commiſſioners to muſter and array the people and ſubjects, and to levy ſuch a number as they ſhould think fit to ſerve them in their wars, and a remedy provided againſt the abuſes, that had formerly been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by divers who abſented themſelves from ſuch mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and brought not their beſt furniture and array with them.<note place="margin">Coke lib. 7.7. B.</note> I will omit the ſtatutes made in the 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and the 2. <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. by which it appeareth that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>England</hi> are bound to go with the King in his wars as well within the Realm as without: I will alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the act not printed made in the fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth concerning the commiſſion of array, as alſo divers other acts and ſtatutes made to that effect and purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo much hath been ſaid about that ſubject already by his Majeſty, in his anſwer to the declaration of both hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament concerning the commiſſion of array.</p>
               <p>Secondly the legiſlative power is another right of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, whereby Kings and ſupreme Magiſtrates are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by juſt and neceſſary laws to provide for the peace and ſafety of their people, and this is wholely and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the King, although he be limited in the exerciſe of his power ſo as he can not make laws without the aſſent of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament. And this is that whith the pretended houſe have ſtood ſo much upon: becauſe the Kings of <hi>England</hi> deſiring to rule their people by lenity, have out of princely clemency con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcended ſo far as not to impoſe upon them (which they anciently did as I ſhall ſhew hereafter) any new law, or alter and repeal the old, without their own conſent, they from the premiſes would make the people believe that their authority is equal to the Kings, and that themſelves as their deputies are coordinate with him: and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the ſhare which they unjuſtly challenged at firſt, they afterwards layd claime to all, wholely excluding the King, and denying him his negative voyce, uſurping and taking upon themſelves the whole power of making laws,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:132567:19"/>whereas they have no other intereſt or authority but what they derive from him: the Statutes declare this in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe tearms,<note place="margin">5.

                  <hi>Lords, and Commons.

E. 3.</note> will appear by the reſolution of the Judges, of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now that the King hath a negative voyce in making laws, and that nothing can or ought to be eſteemed an Act of Parliament without him, is evident by divers Statutes. In the firſt year of King <hi>James</hi> a Statute was made where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the two Houſes petitioning the King, that the recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their duty and obedience, as alſo of his Majeſties right unto the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> might be publiſhed in High Court of Parliament, to remain as a memorial to all poſterity, conclude after this manner, <hi>which if your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhall be pleaſed (as an argument of your gracious acceptation) to adorn with your Majeſties Royal aſſent, without which it can neither be compleat and perfect, nor remain to all poſterity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our humble deſire as a memorial of your Princely and tender affection towards us, we ſhall add this alſo to the reſt of your Majeſties unſpeakable and ineſtimable benefits.</hi> But in the fifteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, a Statute was made on purpoſe to make voyd an Act whereunto the King had promiſed to ſet his Seal, and ſeemed to aſſent, (which by ſome for that reaſon was eſteemed a Statute) becauſe he had not actually aſſented and ſet to his ſeal. Edward <hi>by the grace of God, &amp;c. to the Sheriff of</hi> Lincoln <hi>greeting, whereas at our Parliament ſummoned at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>in the</hi> 15. <hi>of</hi> Eaſter <hi>laſt paſt, certain Articles expreſly contrary to the lawes and cuſtomes of our Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and to our Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and rights Royal were pretended to be granted by us by the manner of a Statute, we conſidering how that by the bond of our Oath we be tyed to the obſervance and defence of ſuch laws, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:132567:19"/>rights, and prerogatives, and providently willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke ſuch things to their own ſtate which be ſo improvidently done; upon conference and treatiſe thereupon had with the Earls, Barons, and other wiſe men of our ſaid Realm, and becauſe we never conſented to the making of the Statute, but as then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved us, we diſſimuled in the premiſſes, by proteſtations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the ſaid ſtatute if indeed it ſhould proceed to eſchew the dangers which by the denying of the ſame, we feared to come, foraſmuch as the ſaid Parliament otherwiſe had been without diſpatching any thing in diſcord diſſolved, and ſo our earneſt buſineſs had likely been ruinated, which God prohibite. and the ſaid pretenſed ſtatute we promiſed then to be ſealed. It ſeemed to the ſaid Earls, Barons and other wiſe men that ſithence the ſtatute did not of our free will proceed, the ſame be void and ought not to have the name nor ſtrength of a ſtatute; and therefore by their counſell and aſſent we have decreed the ſaid ſtatute to be void, and the ſame in as much as it proceeded of deed, we have agreed to be adnulled; willing nevertheleſs that the articles conteined in the ſaid pretenſed ſtatute, which by other of our ſtatutes or of our progenitors Kings of</hi> England <hi>have been approved, ſhall according to the form of the ſaid ſtatute in every point, as convenient is, be obſerved: and the ſame we do onely to the conſervation and reintegration of the rights of our crown, as we be bound, and not that we ſhould in any wiſe grieve or oppreſs our ſubjects, whom we deſire to rule by lenity and gentleneſs. And therefore we do command thee that all theſe things thou cauſe to be openly proclaimed in ſuch places within thy Bailiwick where thou ſhalt ſee expedient, witneſs my ſelf at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>the firſt day of</hi> October <hi>the fifteenth year of our reign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, allegiance or ligeance is another right of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty due onely to Supreme Rulers and Governours; A coordinate Magiſtrate who hath but a parcel and ſhare of authority, can not alone challenge all obedience from the people, for all that are coordinate and have their ſhares in the rights of Soveraignty joyntly taken together make up one ſupreme head, to whom only allegiance or ligeance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:132567:20"/>is due. Now that allegiance or ligiance is due to the King and onely to the King will appear by ſeveral Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. In the firſt year of King <hi>James,</hi> the Lords and Commons declared, that both the ancient and famous Realms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were united in allegiance and loyal ſubjection in his royal perſon,<note place="margin">1. Jac. cap. 2.</note> to his Majeſty and his poſterity for ever; In 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the King is called the liege Lord of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: and in the Acts of Parliament of 13. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. &amp; 11. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſubjects are called the Kings liege people. By other Acts of Parliament di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers oaths have been framed and given to the people, the contents and effects whereof were, that they ſhould bear all faith and allegiance to the King and his heirs: In the ſix and twenty year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth an oath was taken by all the Kings ſubjects for the ſurety of the ſucceſſion of the crown of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">26. H. 8. cap. 2.</note> the oath was this; <hi>Ye ſhall ſwear to bear faith, truth, and obedience all onely to the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and to the heirs of his body of his moſt dear and intirely beloved lawful wife Queen</hi> Anne <hi>begotten and to be begotten, and further to the heirs of our ſaid Soveraign Lord according to the limitation in the ſtatute made for ſurety of his ſucceſſion in the crown of this Realm mentioned and conteined, and not to any other within this Realm, nor forrain authority, or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and in caſe any oath be made, or hath been made by you to any perſon, or perſons, that then ye repute the ſame as vain, and adnihilate, and that to your cunning, wit, and utmoſt of your power, without guile, fraude, or other undue mean, ye ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, keep, maintain, and defend the ſaid act of ſucceſſion and all the whole effects and contents thereof and all other acts and ſtatutes made in confirmation, or for execution of the ſame, or for any thing therein conteined. And this ye ſhall do againſt all manner of perſons, of what eſtate, dignity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or condition ſoever they be. And in no wiſe do or attempt, nor to your power ſuffer to be done or attempted, directly, or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, any thing or things, privately or apertly to the let, hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, damage or derogation thereof, or of any part of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:132567:20"/>ſame by any manner of means or of any manner of pretence; ſo help you God, and all Saints, and the holy Evangeliſts.</hi> There are two things obſervable in this oath, firſt, that they ſwear <hi>inclnſivè</hi> to bear all faith, truth and obedience, to the Kings Majeſty and his heirs, and onely to them; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they ſwear <hi>excluſivè</hi> to bear faith, truth, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to no other either within the realm or without, not to other <hi>perſons,</hi> nor to other <hi>authority,</hi> by both which clauſes of the oath it appears, that the King,<note place="margin">28. H. 8. cap. 7.</note> and none but the King, can challenge faith and allegiance from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Afterwards in the eight and twenty year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth the like oath was injoyned to be taken by all his ſubjects touching his ſucceſſion by Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> for the former Act touching his ſucceſſion by Queen <hi>Anne</hi> was repealed, but the oath injoyned was otherwiſe the ſame; And in the five and thirty year of his reign an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oath was framed, wherein, beſides the contents of the former touching allegiance due to the King and his heirs, ſome other additions were inſerted touching his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes: becauſe the former oaths were not thought full enough to that effect and purpoſe; And theſe oaths were extraordinary and impoſed by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial appointment:<note place="margin">l. 35.</note> But beſides theſe there is another or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary oath of Allegiance which was firſt inſtituted by King <hi>Arthur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">l. 59.</note> and is mentioned amongſt the laws of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and confirmed by the laws of <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour; this oath cominueth ſtill in force and ſhould by the law be given in every Leer. The order and form of it appeareth in <hi>Britton</hi> who wrote in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and compiled a book of the Statutes and lawes which were then in uſe; the effect of it is this:<note place="margin">Coke lib. 7. in Calvins caſe.</note> 
                  <hi>You ſhall ſwear that, that from this day forward you ſhall be true and faithful to our ſoveraign Lord the King and his heirs, and truth and faith ſhall bear of life and member and terrene ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and you ſhall neither know nor hear of any ill or damage intended unto him, that you ſhall not defend ſo help you almighty God.</hi> By this it is clear enough that allegiance is due to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:132567:21"/>the King: the pretended houſe on the other ſide is ſo far from having authority to exact allegiance from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they were all bound themſelves by law to take the oath of Allegiance before they were admitted to ſit in the houſe; and having every one taken the ſaid oath how they ſhould be abſolved, none but themſelves can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, whoſe common practice hath been to play with oaths as children play with toyes and trifles, ſeeming rather to make them their paſtime, then to eſteem them religious acts, or ſacred obligations.</p>
               <p>Fourthly to pardon the tranſgreſſion of the laws, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit treaſon, murder, felony, man-ſlaughter; to appoint ſubordinate Judges; to make leagues with forraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States, all theſe are rights of ſoveraignty; and all theſe are declared and determined by the Statutes of the land to belong to the Kings Majeſty. Firſt the power of pardoning the tranſgreſſions of the law, and of remitting treaſon, murder, felony, manſlaughter, and ſuch like offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is declared and determined to be in the Kings Majeſty by a Statute made in the twenty ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth.<note place="margin">27. H. 8. c. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Where divers of the moſt ancient prerogatives and authorities of Juſtice appertaining to the imperial crown of this realm, have been ſevered and taken from the ſame by ſundry gifts of the Kings moſt noble progenitors, Kings of this realm, to the great diminution and detriment of the Royal eſtate of the ſame, and to the hinderance and great delay of juſtice; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation whereof be it enacted by authority of this preſent Parliament, that no perſon or perſons of what eſtate or degree ſoever they be of from the firſt day of</hi> July <hi>which ſhall be in the year of our Lord God</hi> 1536. <hi>ſhall have any power or authority to pardon, or remit any treaſons, murders, manſlaughters, or felonies, or any utlaries for any ſuch offences aforeſaid, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, perpetrated, done or divulged or hereafter be committed done or divulged by or againſt any perſon or perſons in any part of this Realm,</hi> Wales <hi>or the marches of the ſame; but that the Kings highneſs his heirs and ſucceſſors Kings of this Realm ſhall have the whole and ſole power and authority thereof united and knit
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:132567:21"/>to the imperial crown of this realm, as of good right and equity it appertaineth, any grants, uſages, preſcription, act, or acts of Parliament, or any other thing to the contrary hereof not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.</hi> Secondly the power of appointing ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate judges is declared and determined to be in the King by the ſame Statute. <hi>And be it alſo enacted by authority afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid that no perſon or perſons of what eſtate degree or condition ſoever they be, from the ſaid firſt day of July ſhall have any power or authority to make any juſtices of Eire, juſtices of aſſize, Juſtices of peace or juſtices of Goale delivery: but that all ſuch Officers and Miniſters ſhall be made by Letters Patents under the Kings great Seal, in the name and by authority of the Kings highneſſe and his Heirs Kings of this Realm, in all Shires, Counties, Counties Palatine, and other places of this Realm, Wales, and the marches of the ſame, or in any other his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, at their pleaſure and wills in ſuch manner and form as juſtices of Eire, juſtices of Aſſiſe, and juſtices of peace and juſtices of Goale delivery be commonly made in every ſhire of this Realm, any grants, uſages, preſcription, allowance, act or acts of Parliament, or any other thing or things, to the contrary thereof notwithſtanding.</hi> Thirdly the power of making leagues with forraign Princes and States is declared to be in the King, by a Statute made in the fourteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, which begins thus.<note place="margin">14. E. 4. cap. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Whereas divers and great offences and attempts have now of late been done and committed againſt the amities and leagues made betwixt our ſaid ſoveraign Lord the King and ſtrange Prince.</hi> By this beginning of the Statute it is manifeſt that the power of making leagues and contracting alliance with forraign eſtates is a right belonging onely to the crown. I could yet add divers other acts of Parliament to confirm this and all the other particulars above named, but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe which are already alledged are more then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; there are alſo other rights of Soveraignty which I could ſhew by the ſtatutes to be in the King, but becauſe there is no conteſtation about them, I will not fight with a ſhadow; thoſe above mentioned are the chiefeſt and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from Majeſty.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Kings Supremacy in general ſhewed by the Common Law.</head>
               <p>HAving ſhewed the Kings Supremacy from the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, I come now to the Common law, which is the ground and foundation of it; for Statutes are but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of the royal power, the power it ſelf with the ſeveral modifications and qualifications of it is more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then any ſtatute, and cannot be limited or reſtrained by an Act of Parliament in any thing that tends to the derogation or diminution of Majeſty: for the Engliſh Monarchy by the common law is an abſolute Monarchy ſuſceptible of no alteration in the rights and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences of Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Firſt I ſay the Engliſh Monarchy is an abſolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy by the Common Law admitting no mixture in the rights of Soveraignty, the King alone being the onely ſupreme head and governour having none ſuperiour to him or coordinate with him either ſingly, or collectively taken, this is expreſly determined in Sir <hi>Edward Cokes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. <hi>If that Act of the firſt year of the late Queen had never been made, it was reſolved by all the judges that the King or Queen of</hi> England <hi>for the time being may make ſuch an Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion as is before mentioned by the ancient prerogative and Law of</hi> England.<note place="margin">Coke lib. 5. in Caudreys caſe.</note> 
                  <hi>And therefore by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws of the realm this Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Empire and Monarchy conſiſting of one head which is the King and of a body politick compact and compounded of many and almoſt infinite ſeveral and yet agreeing members; all which the law divideth into two general parts, that is to ſay the Clergy, and the laitie, both of them next and immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:132567:22"/>God ſubject and obedient to the head; alſo the King head of this Politick body is inſtituted and furniſhed with plenary and iutire power, prerogative, and juriſdiction to render juſtice and right to every part and member of this body of what eſtate degree or calling ſoever, in all cauſes Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he ſhould not be head of the whole body.</hi> This is further proved by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> by divers Precedents and Acts of Parliament, who concludeth his report after this manner.<note place="margin">Fol. 40.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus hath it appeared as well by the ancient common lawes of this Realm, by the reſolutions and judgements of the judges, and ſages of the Lawes of</hi> England <hi>in all ſucceſſion of ages, as by authority of many acts of Parliament ancient and of later times, that the Kingdome of</hi> England <hi>is an abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and that the King is the only ſupream governour as well over Eccleſiaſtical perſons and in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes as temporal within this Realm; to the due obſervation of which Laws both the King and Subject are ſworn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond year of King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Hillary</hi> Terme let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being directed to the judges to have their reſolution concerning the validity of a grant made by Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> under the great ſeal, of the benefit of a penal Statute in which grant power was given to the Lord Chancelour or Keeper of the great Seal, to make diſpenſations when and to whom he pleaſed, after great deliberation it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that when a Statute is made by Act of Parliament for the publick good, the King could not give the power of diſpenſation to any Subject, or grant the forfeitures upon penal lawes to any before the ſame be recovered and veſted in his Majeſty by due and lawful proceeding: and the reaſon there alledged is, becauſe the King as head of the Common-wealth, and the fountain of juſtice and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ought to have theſe rights of Soverainty annexed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Royal perſon.<note place="margin">Coke lib. 7. tit. penall.

                  <hi>Car quant un ſtatute eſt fait pro bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no publico &amp; le Rey (come le teſte del bien publique &amp; le foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine de juſtice &amp; mercie) eſt par tout le realme truſt ove ceo ceſt conſidence &amp; truſt eſt cy inſeparablement adjoyne &amp; annexe al Royal perſon del Roy in cy haut point de ſoveraigntie, que il ne poit transferre ceo al diſpoſition on poiar d'aſcune privat
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:132567:23"/>perſon ou al aſcune privat uſe,</hi> that is, For when a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is made for the publick good and the King (as head of the Common-wealth and the fountain of juſtice and mercy) is by all the Realm truſted with it, that confidence and truſt is ſo inſeperably annexed to the Royal perſon of the King in ſo high a point of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he cannot transfer it to the diſpoſition or power of a private perſon or to any private uſe. I ſhall not need to explain and amplifie the matter by arguments and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences drawn from theſe reports for the words are clear of themſelves, and do expreſly declare and reſolve the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>England</hi> to be an abſolute Monarchy, the King alone to be the only ſupreme head and Governour of the whole body, that is, of all the people, as well collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſeverally taken.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, (namely in regard of the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy he being the only head of the Kingdome, having no equal or Superiour but God alone, whoſe Vicegerent he is upon earth) that the Common law doth by way of fiction and ſimilitude attribute unto him the Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.<note place="margin">1.

               <p>There are alſo divers prerogatives and priviledges by the Common law belonging to the King, and divers Acts which the King may do, or not do, by reaſon of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy: The King ſhall not in his writ give any man the ſtyle or title of <hi>Dominus</hi> becauſe it is unbeſeeming his Majeſty to uſe that tearm to any, he being himſelf <hi>omnium ſubditorum ſupremus Dominus,</hi> the ſupream and ſoveraign Lord of all his ſubjects: and in this caſe although there be variance between the Writ and Obligation,<note place="margin">8. E. 6.23. B. 11. E 4.2. 8. E. 4.2.</note> or other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty, yet the Writ ſhall not abate, which it ſhall in other caſes, as if they vary in the name, or ſirname, or if they vary in the ſurn.</p>
               <p>The King can hold land of no man,<note place="margin">Aſ. p. 1.18. Elizab. 498.</note> becauſe he can have no ſuperiour, but on the other ſide all lands either immediately or mediately ate holden of him as Soveraign Lord: for although a man hath a perpetual right in his eſtate, yet he hath it in the nature of a fee; and whether it cometh to him by deſcent, or purchaſe, he oweth a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:132567:24"/>rent or duty for it: and therefore when in pleading a man would ſignifie himſelf to have the greateſt right in his eſtate,<note place="margin">Littleton f. 3.</note> he ſaith, <hi>Que il eſt ou fuit ſeiſe de ceo en ſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſne come de fee,</hi> that he is or was ſeiſed thereof in his demeaſne as of fee; and if a man holds his eſtate imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately of the King, as of his Crown or perſon, this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure is called a tenure <hi>in capite,</hi> becauſe he holds it of the ſupreme <hi>head</hi> of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>If a man holdeth land both of the King and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Lords whereby his heir becometh a Ward, the King alone ſhall have the cuſtody both of the heir and land, the reaſon which is rendered in law is becauſe the King can have none coordinate with him, or ſuperiour to him. Glanvil. lib. 7. cap. 10. <hi>Si quis in Capite de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino Rege tenere debet, tunc ejus cuſtodia ad Dominum Regem plene pertinet: ſive alios Dominos habere debeat ipſe haeres, ſive non, quia Dominus Rex nullum habere poteſt parem, multo minus ſuperiorem. i. e.</hi> If any man houldeth land of our Lord the King <hi>in capite,</hi> then his wardſhip ſhall wholly belong to our Lord the King, whether he hath other Lords or not, becauſe the King can have no equal, much leſs a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.

This is all the help which a ſubject hath againſt the King, becauſe he is ſupreme, and bound to give an account of his actions to none but God, and this is the courſe which the two houſes of Parliament are to take by law in caſe the King infringeth or is ſuppoſed to infringe the rights and liberties of the people, as will appear by divers pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of right exhibited in former Parliaments.</p>
               <p>Secondly I ſay, the Engliſh Monarchy by the common law is ſuſceptible of no alteration in the rights and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminences of Majeſty, I mean by any Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by any agreement of King and people: what a conqueror in a juſt war, or what the people may do in caſe the blood Royal, which God prohibit, ſhould be extinct, is not now diſputable: but ſo long as there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a King, or heir apparent to the crown, the rights and preheminences of Majeſty can by no act, agreement, ſtipulation, or covenant made between King and people be ſevered and taken from the crown; ſhould the King unwarily by Act of Parliament conſent to any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial and derogatory to his Royal prerogative, ſuch Acts are void by the common law, and the Judges (being bound by oath to aſſent to nothing that may turn to the Kings hinderance or damage) are bound to declare them ſo,<note place="margin">23.

By a Statute made in the twenty third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt it is ordained that no man ſhall continue Sheriff of a Shire above one year, and that all patents from the King of that office, for term of years, of life, in fee ſimple, or in fee taile ſhould be void any clauſe or word of <hi>non obſtante</hi> in any wiſe put or to be put into ſuch patents to be made notwithſtanding;<note place="margin">2.

But if the Statute ſay his licence ſhall be void, there the licenſe ſhall have a clauſe of <hi>non obſtante, viz.</hi> it ſhall ſay any Statute to the contrary notwithſtanding, or otherwiſe it is not good: As the Statute 23. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 18. is that the grant of the King to be Sheriff of a Shire longer then a year, ſhall be void, notwithſtanding his patent ſhall have a clauſe of <hi>non obſtante,</hi> and yet with a clauſe of <hi>non obſtante</hi> ſuch a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhall be good.

That which I have hitherto ſaid of the rights and preheminences of Majeſty, is to be underſtood of thoſe rights and preheminences that are ſo eſſential to it, as they cannot be ſeparted without the diminution or deſtruction of Majeſty. As the power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> the power of making laws, the power of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Judges, and ſuch like Acts of juriſdiction, as alſo the power of diſpenſing with penal Statutes, the power of pardoning the tranſgreſſions of the Law, the power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the law, and ſuch like ſupreme acts of juſtice and mercy: ſome of which rights and preheminences cannot be taken away without giving a wound, others not without bringing death, and diſſolution to Majeſty: yet there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rights and preheminences that are called priviledges which are not ſo eſſential to Majeſty, but that they may by, ſpecial grace of the King be ſeparated. Bracton. lib. 2. cap. 24. <hi>Ea vero quae juriſdictionis ſunt &amp; pacis &amp; ea quae ſunt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae &amp; paci annexa ad nullum pertinent niſi ad Coronam &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem Regiam, nec à Corona ſeparari poterunt cum faciant ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam Coronam.

               <p>It may ſeem ſtrange that the King and the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132567:26"/>and Temporal, and the Houſe of Commons, which are virtually the whole kingdome, ſhould not have power to make what Laws they pleaſe, and to bind themſelves and the whole kingdome by them in things not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the law of God; yet if we conſider the ground of this reſtraint, we ſhall find it reaſonable: for they which lay the firſt foundation of a Common-wealth, have authority to make lawes that cannot be altered by poſterity in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that concern the rights both of King and people: for foundations cannot be removed without the ruin and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the whole building: As for example, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of things which is made at the firſt foundation of a Commonwealth (whether the people took the countrey they divide from the Inhabitants by conqueſt in a juſt war, or whether they did firſt actually poſſeſſe it themſelves as being before emptie and vacant) cannot be altered by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and a new diviſion made without manifeſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. The Laws which they then make for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their right and propriety in the ſaid diviſion, can not be diſannulled by ſucceeding Parliaments, nor can any particular man be deprived of his inheritance, which deſcends unto him by virtue of that diviſion, or of any part or parcel, or appurtenances thereof, by any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry law which ſhall be made by them; I ſpeak not what Parliaments may do by force, but what they may juſtly do; for they have not ſuch an arbitrary power, but that they are alwayes in a morall ſubjection to the rules of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and natural equity. And in this caſe the Kings condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought not to be worſe then the peoples, but his ſhare and rights in the ſaid diviſion are as firmly and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to be preſerved, as the ſhare and rights of particular men: And both the King and people are obliged to this, not only by the rules of Juſtice, and natural equity, but by oath, and by the municipal Lawes of the Land,<note place="margin">l. 17.</note> to which they are both ſworn. That the King is bound to this, appears by the Lawes of King <hi>Edward. Debet vero de jure Rex omnes terras, &amp; honores, omnes dignitates, &amp;

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Kings Supremacy in particular ſhewed by the Common Law.</head>
               <p>I Come now to the particular rights of Soveraignty, which are all by the Common law wholly in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the King. Firſt,<note place="margin">19 E. 4.6. Coke 7.25. B.</note> the <hi>Militia</hi> is his by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and to him it only pertaineth, to make War with forrain Princes and Eſtates; as alſo to maintain the peace, to ſuppreſſe Rebellions, and to ſee juſtice execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at home within his own Kingdome: Fleta lib. 1 cap. 17. <hi>Habet Rex in manu ſua omnia jura quae ad Coronam &amp; Laita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem pertinent poteſtatem, &amp; materialem gladium qui pertinet ad Regni gubernaculum. i. e.</hi> The King hath all the rights in his hand which belong to the Crown, and to Temporal juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and the power of the ſword, which belong to the Government of the Kingdome. So likewiſe ſaith <hi>Bracton,</hi> lib. 1. cap. 8. <hi>Sunt &amp; alii potentes ſub Rege qui dicuntur Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones, hoc eſt robut belli, ſunt &amp; alii qui dicuntur Vavaſores, viri magnae dignitatis, vavaſor enim nihil melius dici poterit quam vas fortium ad valetudinem. sunt &amp; ſub Rege milites, ſ. ad militiam exercendam electi. i. e.</hi> There are other great men under the King which are called Barons, and other which are called Vavaſours, men of great dignity. There are alſo ſoldiers under the King choſen to exerciſe the <hi>Militia.</hi> And in the beginning of his Book he ſaith that it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary this power ſhould be in the King. <hi>In rege quirecte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, neceſſaria ſunt duo haec, arma videlicet &amp; Leges, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus utrumque tempus bellorum &amp; pacis recte poſſit gubernari: utrumque enim iſtorum alter, us indiget auxilio, quo tam res
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132567:28"/>militaris poſſit eſſe tuta, quam ipſae Leges uſu armorum &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidio poſſint eſſe ſervatae. Si autem arma defecerint contra hoſtes, rebelle, &amp; indomitos ſic erit regnum indefenſum: Si autem Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſic exterminabitur juſtitia. i. e.</hi> In a King that governeth well, two things are neceſſary, armes and lawes, by which he may be enabled to rule both in times of peace and war; and both theſe help the need of one another, whereby both armes and lawes may be preſerved. If arms be wanting againſt enemies, and rebells, the Kingdome ſhall be without defence; if Lawes be wanting, without juſtice. This is alſo evident from the Tenures, whereby moſt of the chief men in the Kingdome hold their eſtates: for all that hold <hi>in capite</hi> by Knights ſervice, are bound for their fee to aſſiſt the King in his wars, whenſoever they ſhall be ſummoned by him; whether it be to ſuppreſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, or to reſiſt a forraign invaſion. And this hath been the known Law of the Land ever ſince the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, in the fourth year of whoſe reign this right was confirmed unto him by Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament: The words of the Statute are theſe, <hi>Statuinus &amp; firmiter pracipimus, ut omnes Comites, &amp; Barones, &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, &amp; Servientes, &amp; univerſi liberi homines totitu regni noſtri praedicti habeant &amp; teneant ſe ſemper bene in armis, &amp; in equis ut decet &amp; oportet, &amp; quod ſint ſemper prompti &amp; parati ad ſervitium ſuum integrum nobis explendum &amp; peragendum, cum ſemper opus adfuerit, ſecundum quod nobis debent de feodis &amp; tenementis ſuis de jure facere, &amp; ſicut illis ſtatuimus per com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune conſilium totius Regni noſtri praedicti, &amp; illis dedimus, &amp; conceſſimus in feodis jure hereditario. i. e.</hi> We will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that all Earls, Barons, Knights, Villeins, and all Freemen of out whole kingdom, be alwayes well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with horſe and armes, as it behoveth them, and that they be alwayes in a readineſſe to ſerve us as often as need ſhall require according as they are bound by their Lands and Tenements, and as we have appointed them to do by the Common-Councell of our whole Kingdome, and <hi>for that conſideration</hi> have given and granted them lands in Fee for ever.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:132567:28"/>
               <p> Secondly, The Legiſlative power belongs to the King alone by the Common Law, the two Houſes have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity granted them by the King to aſſent or diſſent, but the power that makes it a law, the authority that animates it and makes it differ from a dead Letter, is in the King, who is the life and ſoul of the law, by whoſe authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the lawes command, and forbid, and vindicate, and puniſh offenders. So ſaith Bracton lib. 1. cap. 2. <hi>Hujuſmodi verò Leges Anglicanae, &amp; conſuetudines, Regum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate jubent quandoque, quandoque vetant, &amp; quandoque vindicant &amp; puniunt tranſgreſſores. i. e.</hi> Theſe Lawes and cuſtomes of England by the Kings authority do ſometimes command, ſometimes ſorbid, and ſometimes chaſtiſe and puniſh tranſgreſſors. This was alſo reſolved by divers Earls and Barons, and by all the juſtices in the time of Edward the third: For one <hi>Haedlow</hi> and his wife having a controverſy with the King, and deſiring to have it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in Parliament, a reference being made to divers Earls, and Barons, and to all the juſtices, to conſider of the buſineſſe, it was reſolved that the two houſes were not coordinate with the King in the Legiſlative power, but that the King alone made lawes by the aſſent of the two Houſes, that he had none equal or coordinate with him in his Realm, and that he could not be judged by the Parliament.<note place="margin">22. E. 3.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Fuit dit que le Roy fiſt les leis per aſſent des peres &amp; de la Commune, &amp; non pas les peres, &amp; le Commune: Et que il ne avera nul pere en ſa terre demeſne, &amp; que le Roy per eux ne doit eſtr. ajuge. i. e.</hi> It was reſolved that the King makes lawes by the aſſent of the Lords and Commons: and not the Lords and Commons, and that he could have no Peer in his own land, and that he could not be judged by them.</p>
               <p>The Common practice of the law confirms this as well as the reſolution of the Judges; for the breach of any Statute whether it be by treaſon murder, felony perjury, or by any other way, is an offence againſt the Kings authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alone, and pleas made againſt ſuch offences are called the pleas of the crown, becauſe they are done <hi>encounter
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:132567:29"/>la corone &amp; dignitie le Roy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stanford les plees del corone. lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> againſt the crown and dignity of the King. So that it is not the dignity and authority of the Lords and Commons which is violated by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the law, but the dignity and authority of the King.</p>
               <p>He may diſpenſe alſo with ſuch laws as forbid a thing which is not <hi>malum in ſe,</hi> and pardon the tranſgreſſion of others, as Treaſon, Felony, and the like; which in reaſon he ought no more to do, then to diſpenſe with the laws of <hi>Germany, Spain,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> or pardon the tranſgreſſours thereof, if they were not made by his own authority.</p>
               <p>Again it is an uncontroulable Maxime of Law, <hi>Ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem eſt leges interpretari cujus eſt condere:</hi> None can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the laws, but the ſame power that makes them: Now that the King calling the Judges to him hath this power, is evident by his expoſition upon the Statute of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> made in the ſixt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, extant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the printed Statutes, and following immediately after the ſaid Statute, in theſe words. <hi>After by the King and his Juſtices certain expoſitions were made upon ſome of the articles above mentioned, that is to wit, to the firſt article, for entries by diſſeiſin, damages ſhall run from the time of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute publiſhed. In the ſame wiſe, in writs of</hi> entre <hi>upon diſſeiſin in all writs of</hi> Mortdaunceſter. Couſenage, Aiel <hi>or</hi> Befaiel, <hi>of intruſion by one act by any manner of writ, damages ſhall run after the writ purchaſed againſt them that held by Statute, albeit their anceſtors died ſeiſed thereof,</hi> &amp;c. Here we ſee to whom the interpretation of the law belongeth, the Judges by themſelves have a power to interpret it <hi>judicialiter,</hi> they could not otherwiſe proceed to judgement; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called by the King, with him, and under him, they have a power to interpret it <hi>authoritative</hi> as hath been the practice, and is the known law of the Land. But for the two houſes (beſides that they can do nothing joyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, unleſs the King doth actually concurre with them) their ſtructure is ſuch that they are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable and unfit to interpret law: For the power that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:132567:29"/>law muſt be always exiſtent to act as new occaſions ſhall ariſe, which requires the exerciſe of that power, which the two houſes are not. And yet were they alwayes exiſtent, both houſes having a negative voyce, upon any diſagreement between them, the interpretation of the law muſt be retarded, and all controverſies depending thereupon undecided: and this diſagreement might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps endure for ever, and ſo a final determination in ſuch ſuites would be impoſſible. Now theſe are inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which ought not to be admitted in any common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: for it derogates both from the honour and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of a Nation to be ſo moulded and framed, that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice cannot have a free paſſage in all contingencies.</p>
               <p>I will yet adde for the further clearing of this point, that not only the legiſlative power it ſelf, but the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the power alſo, ſo far as it is eſſential to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in the King alone; for he can by edicts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations provide for all neceſſary occaſions, and ſpecial emergencies, not provided for by fixed and certain laws; which is one of the moſt excellent and eminent acts of the legiſlative power, and a ſufficient remedy againſt all miſchiefs, in caſe the two houſes ſhould refuſe to concur with him in thoſe things which concern the benefit of the Kingdome. He may alſo grant immunities, liberties, and priviledges, to any <hi>colledge, town, city,</hi> or <hi>incorporation,</hi> and authoriſe the ſaid communities to make ſuch local Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes as ſhall oblige every member thereof ſo far as they contradict not the general Statutes of the Land, which are all acts of the legiſlative power that he can exerciſe without the concurrence of the two houſes.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the Kings negative voice,<note place="margin">12. H. 7.10. 4. H. 7.18. 7. H. 14. Judge <hi>Jenkins</hi> fol. 18.</note> it is the known law that the King hath a power of diſſenting, and that no act of Parliament can have any authority except either in perſon or under his ſeal he ſignifies his aſſent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly allegeance or ligeancy is due to the King, and none but the King by the Common law, as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſheweth at large in <hi>Calvins</hi> caſe from the reſolution
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:132567:30"/>of the Judges. <hi>By that which hath been ſaid appeareth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that this ligeance is due onely to the King ſo as therein the queſtion is not now</hi> cui ſed quomodo debetur. <hi>It is true that the King hath two capacities in him, one a natural body being diſcended of the blood Royal of the realm, and this body is of the creation of almighty God, and is ſubject to death, infirmity, and ſuch like; The other is a politick body or capacity, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led becauſe it is framed by the policy of man (and in the</hi> 21. <hi>E.</hi> 4.39. <hi>B. is called a myſtical body) and in this capacity the King is eſteemed to be immortal, inviſible, not ſubject to death, infirmity, infancy, nonage, &amp;c. Vide Pl. Com. in le Caſe de Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor Barclay</hi> 238. <hi>Et in the caſe del duchie</hi> 213. <hi>vide</hi> 6. <hi>E.</hi> 3.291. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. <hi>aſſ. pl.</hi> 54. <hi>Now ſeeing the King hath but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſeveral capacities, and one politick capacity for the realm of</hi> England, <hi>and another for the realm of</hi> Scotland, <hi>it is neceſſary to be conſidered to which capacity ligeance is due, and it was reſolved that it was due to the natural perſon of the King, which is ever accompanied with the politick capacity, and the politick capacity as it were appropriated to the natural capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and is not due to the politick capacity onely; that is to the crown or Kingdome diſtinct from his natural capacity.</hi> In the ſame caſe a little after it followeth. <hi>And where divers books and Acts of Parliament ſpeak of the ligeance of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>as the</hi> 31. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>tit. Coſinage</hi> 5.42. <hi>E.</hi> 3.2.13. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>tit. Bre.</hi> 677.25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Statut.</hi> 2. De natisultra mare. <hi>All theſe and divers other ſpenking briefly in a vulgar manner</hi> (<hi>for</hi> loquendum ut vulgus) <hi>and not pleading</hi> (<hi>for</hi> ſentiendum ut docti) <hi>are to be underſtood of the ligeance due by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the King. For no man will affirm that</hi> England <hi>it ſelf ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for the continent thereof, doth owe any ligeance or faith, or that any ligeance of faith ſhould be due to it; but it manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth, that the ligeance or faith of the ſubject is</hi> proprium quarto modo <hi>to the King,</hi> omni, ſoli, &amp; ſemper.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the power of making Judges, and all ſuch State officers as exerciſe any juriſdiction, is in the King alone by the Common law, and can not, nor ought not to be ſeparated from him: for it is not reaſonable that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:132567:30"/>Judges ſhould be ſubſtituted by any but thoſe whoſe delegates they are; nor can a King execute ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice according to his oath (which next the Glory of God is the chief end of Government) by a naked title onely; His ſubjects may be vexed by the rapine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of unjuſt Judges, they may be wearied by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, exhauſted by inſupportable fees, oppreſt many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, and the King in the mean time muſt ſtand ſtill and look on, if his hands be bound, and he diſabled from puniſhing their delinquencies &amp; deputing others into their places. And therefore this power cannot be diſunited from the crown but ought to be <hi>de jure,</hi> as it hath alwayes been <hi>de facto,</hi> a part of the Kings prerogative. <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 3. <hi>tit. de actionibus, cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Et ſi ipſe Dominus Rex ad ſingulas cauſas terminandas non ſufficiat, ut levior ſit illi labor in plures per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonas partito onere, eligere debet de regno ſuo viros ſapientes &amp; timentes Deum, in quibus ſit veritas eloquiorum, qui &amp; ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt avaritiam (quae inducit cupiditatem) &amp; ex illis conſtituere Juſticiarios, Vicecomites, &amp; alios Ballivos, &amp; Miniſtros ſuos, quibus referantur tam quaeſtiones ſuper dubiis, quam querimoniae ſuper injuriis. i. e.</hi> And if our Lord the King be not ſufficient to determine all controverſies himſelf, he ought to ſelect wiſe men, fearing God, and hating cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and out of them conſtitute Juſtices, Sheriffs, Bailies, and other officers, to whom controverſies and complaints may be referred. The practice of the law hath alwayes been the ſame ſince <hi>Bracton</hi>'s time, and all Judges and chief officers appointed by writ, patent, or commiſſion from the King. Hence it is that all patents and commiſſion of Judges, and other ſuch officers, are determined by the common law at the Kings death. <hi>Coke tit. diſcontinue de proces, &amp;c. part.</hi> 7.30. <hi>Al common ley per demiſe le Roy le plea fuit diſcontinue, &amp; le proces que fuit agard, &amp; nient returne devant le mort, le Roy fuit perde: Car per le breve del predeceſſor rien poit eſtre execute in le temps del novel Roy, ſi non que il ſoit in eſpecial caſes; car le

               <p>Fifthly, the power of making leagues and contracting alliance, as alſo of making war with foraign States is in the King alone. <hi>Coke lib.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Leagues between our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and others are the means to make aliens friends,</hi> &amp; foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera percutere <hi>to make leagues, onely and wholly pertaineth to the King: wars do make aliens enemies, and</hi> bellum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicere <hi>belongeth onely and wholly to the King, and not to the ſubject, as appearath in</hi> 19. <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 6.6.

There are yet other rights of Majeſty as the power of Coynage, the power of granting letters patents of Denization, the power of diſpenſing with ſuch laws, as are diſpenſable, and the power of pardoning the tranſgreſſion of them, with divers others, all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the King by the Common law; but becauſe they are not called in queſtion, I will paſs them over.</p>

               <p>Firſt, that power which is ſo under controul that it can be annihilated at the will of another, muſt needs be inferiour to that power which doth ſo overrule and maſter it; Now ſuch is the condition of Parliaments, that the King by law can annihilate them at his pleaſure; for they depend upon him <hi>quoad exiſtentiam</hi> for their exiſtence and continuance: If it ſhould be granted that Parliaments are <hi>in actu ſignato</hi> by original conſtitution, yet the preciſe time of their exiſtence, and continuance, hath alwayes been at the Kings appointment, it being in his power to call them and diſſolve them when he pleaſe, ſo that they muſt needs be ſubordinate to him and depend upon him for their operation, when they depend upon him for their exiſtence.</p>

                  </label> What needed the <hi>reverent Divines</hi> to have cited theſe <hi>wiſe men?</hi> Could they not as eaſily have ſaid themſelves, that Parliaments could not be diſſolved by the Kings command, as they ſaid they might be called without it? Perhaps they thought that ſuch notorious falſities would never paſs currently amongſt the people, if they were not confirmed by the authority of <hi>wiſe men</hi> as well as by their owne: yet I beleeve the <hi>wiſe men</hi> they ſpeak of were not ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> as <hi>Thales Mileſius,</hi> but whatſoever they were, their magiſteriall dictates muſt not paſſe for law; for both that which theſe <hi>wiſe men</hi> affirm, and that which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>themſelves,</hi> is manifeſtly oppoſit to law and truth. There was never yet ſince the firſt foundation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie a Parliament called without a legall warrant from the King, nor can a Parliament be called without it; for the caſes put by them are altogether impertinent, and can not be ſuppoſed: the King according to his politique ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity can not be a priſoner, or an infant, or diſtracted, but in caſe his condition be ſuch as make him uncapable to guide and manage his charge in perſon, as in caſe of infancy, or diſtraction, the law hath made ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion who ſhall exerciſe the regall power in ſuch occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies; if he be priſoner in the enemies hands he may ſubſtitute others, or if he be ſo cloſely kept as that can not be permitted, in ſuch events alſo the law is not deficient: but in all theſe caſes nothing can be acted by authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the people, but by the Kings authority, which can never be in priſon, nor is it ſubject to infancy or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction; and Parliaments called at ſuch time, by thoſe that have authority by law to exerciſe the Royall power, are called by a legall warrant from the King; and without
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:132567:32"/>ſuch a legall warrant they never were nor can be called: It there have been any generall Conventions without it, as the <hi>reverent Divines</hi> (who ſhould have done well to have quoted their authors, and their words) aſſure us, their acts were never eſteemed lawes, nor ſuch Conventions, Parliaments. And that the King hath a power by law of diſſolving Parliaments when he ſhall think it fit, hath been alwayes without controverſy: The two houſes in the laſt Parliament, though thrifty managers of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,<note place="margin">Modus te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendi Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum 4. pars inſtit. fol 3.4.</note> never claimed an arbitrary power of ſitting without the Kings aſſent: It is a known <hi>Maxime</hi> of the law, <hi>Rex eſt Principium, Caput, &amp; Finis Parliamenti.</hi> The King is the <hi>Beginning,</hi> the <hi>Head,</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he that laſt faſhioned and reformed the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Monarchie obtained the crown by conqueſt; he had it not by election as a gift and gratuity of the people, but made his paſſage by the Sword: and Conquerours are not wont to allow of ſuch coordinations, or admit ſo many ſharers in the rights of Soveraigntie as it is phantaſied.</p>

                  </label> I deny not a compoſition and agreement, but I ſay there was none ſuch as is pretended: for the compoſition and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement was made after a victory; and it is not probable that the conquerour having been at ſuch expence of blood in gaining the crown and rights of Soveraignty, ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his victory give them away again, and agree to ſuch a mixture as is pleaded for. And although it may be juſtly exacted from them to prove that there was ſuch a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:132567:33"/>and agreement, as they ſpeak of, made between them; yet I will take the burden of proving upon my ſelf, and ſhew there was not: for all the compoſition and agreement which was made or reported to be made by any author, was a grant from the conquerour that the Kingdom ſhould injoy the ancient lawes and cuſtomes, whereby it had been formerly governed, which were called the lawes of King <hi>Edward:</hi> this he performed, being moved by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions and inſtances of the people, in the fourth year of his reign, wherin he confirmed unto them the ſaid lawes and cuſtomes. Now amongſt the lawes of King <hi>Edward</hi> there is nothing to be found that can give the leaſt colour or pretence for ſuch a coordination as is conceited, but on the other ſide the Kings ſupremacy is chiefly eſtabliſhed by the ancient lawes of the land, for the common law was the ſame it is now, before the conqueſt, and is the baſe and pillar of Royall power, as hath already been ſhewed ſufficiently: To which I could adde many other things out of the lawes of King <hi>Edward</hi> wherein the King is declared to be a Monarch and to be Gods vicegerent conſtituted and ordained to govern the Kingdome (which includes the people collectively taken) and his Church, and to protect and defend them (which is an act belonging onely to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame authority, and which can not be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it) from injuries and oppreſſion.<note place="margin">

But the truth is, there is a great diſtance between Counſels and Commands: Counſellours are but ſubordinate offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and may not impoſe their Counſells for Lawes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe which they ſerve in that employment.</p>

                  </label> Although the Lords be born Counſellours, and the Commons choſen by the people, yet they cannot ſit in Counſell, but at ſuch times as the King is pleaſed to make uſe of them, and when he is pleaſed to ſummon them and command them to ſit, the Lords cannot refuſe to come, or the people to ſend their Deputies: nor doth it alter their condition, whether they be born his Counſellours, given him by the people, or choſen by himſelf; they which are born to places of dignity and juriſdiction, or they which are choſen to them by the people, ceaſe not for all that to be ſubordinate to the King; they are all his Subjects and Miniſters, and are ſo far from having au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to challenge obedience to their Counſels, that if their Counſells be not ſuch as they ought, they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obnoxious to a cenſure of Law. A King is obliged in time of Parliament to follow the advice and direction of the two Houſes, and out of Parliament of his Privy Counſell, when their advice and direction tendeth to the preſervation of his perſon, and of his Royal authority,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132567:35"/>and to the preſervation of his people, and of their rights and priviledges; not that Counſellours have authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Kings, but becauſe the matter of their Counſels do morally oblige their conſciences: but if their advice and direction tend to the ruin of either, he may and ought to recede from their Counſels; and ſuch a King is not a tyrant, but ſuch Counſellours traitors by the law. This is myſteriouſly repreſented to the Lords when they are firſt preferred to that degree and dignity, by the uſuall ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities then performed; for if in ſtead of giving counſell for the King, they give counſell againſt him, they are not only by the Statutes of the Land declared to be trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but if the Statutes were ſilent, by a tacite condition of law annexed to their dignities, and vayled under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ceremonies uſed at their firſt creation, they are to be condemned for ſuch, and to forfeit their eſtates. Coke in Nevils caſe lib. 7. fol. 34. <hi>Ceux que ſont countees ount of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice de graund truſt &amp; confidence, &amp; ſont create pur</hi> 2. <hi>purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> 1. ad conſulendum regi tempore pacis: 2. ad defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum regem &amp; patriam tempore belli. <hi>Et pur c. anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie ad done eux</hi> 2. <hi>enſignes a reſembler ceux deux duties: car primeremt. lour teſte eſt adorn ove un capoe de honor, &amp; coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, &amp; lour corps ove unrobe in reſemblance de counſel: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundmt. ilz ſout ſuccinct ove un eſpee in reſemblans q. ilz ſerr.

               <p>Fourthly the Parliament is one of the Kings courts, as is apparent both by our Statutes and law books;<note place="margin">1. Iac. cap 1. Bracton lib. 2. cap. 16.

And yet all that he ſaith, if it were conſiſtent with reaſon, is not ſufficient to make the Parliament his Majeſties court, except it deriveth all authority and juriſdiction from him; it is not enough that they are <hi>an aſſembly of his ſubjects;</hi> for in divers forrain Nations, Eccleſiaſtical perſons are ſubjects to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they live under, yet Eccleſiaſtical courts belong not to thoſe Princes, but to the Sea of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor is it enough which he addeth, that they are ſummoned <hi>by his writ;</hi> for the Judges of divers courts, but chiefly of courts Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, have ſent out citations and ſummons, in their own name, as the King doth by writ, and yet they are not the proprietaries of thoſe courts; nor yet is it ſufficient that they are his Councell; for his Counſellours make it not his Court but his Authority; It is authority that conſtitutes a court, and inables it to proceed judicially; he which ownes that, is owner and Maſter of the Court.</p>

               <p>I <hi>Ecgfride</hi> by the grace of God King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> in the year of our Lord ſeven hundred ninety ſix in the fourth Indiction, and firſt year of our reign, do give grant, for my own ſoul, and the ſouls of my Anceſtors with the aſſent and reſtimony of my Nobles, ten Hydes of Land called <hi>Tyrefeld</hi> with the Bounds thereof, unto the Monaſtery of Saint <hi>Albane:</hi> and I exempt the ſaid Lands from all Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and make them free with the ſame freedome which was granted to the reſt of the Lands of the ſame Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by <hi>Offa</hi> our father of glorious memory.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Charter</hi> was written at <hi>Chelehyd</hi> in a publike Synod.</p>
               <p>By this Charter it is evident, that Parliaments were holden in thoſe times without the Commons; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſpecified by the King, that the aboveſaid lands were given <hi>cum conſenſu &amp; teſtimonio optimatum,</hi> his meaning is, that his grant was confirmed by the aſſent and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Parliament; and yet the word <hi>Optimates</hi> cannot be extended to the Commons, neither was his grant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by their teſtimony. In the prefaces likewiſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Saxon Lawes</hi> ſet out by Mr. <hi>Lambart</hi> the perſons are expreſſed by whoſe counſell and aſſent the ſaid Laws were
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:132567:38"/>enacted; yet, except only in the preface of King <hi>Inas</hi> Lawes, there is no mention at all made of the Commons, but ſeveral Kings made moſt of thoſe Lawes by the advice and conſent of their Biſhops, and wiſe men, which were no other then their Privy Counſel; Mr. <hi>Lambart</hi> in his <hi>Archaion</hi> affirmeth them to be the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and to ſupport his opinion he alleadgeth a paſſage out of the Preface of the Lawes of King <hi>Elfred</hi> which is neither material, nor ſaithfully cited; for there is no ſuch paſſage to be found in that Preface. But to make his errour apparent I ſhall need no other teſtimonies, then two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents mentioned by himſelf, the firſt is of a Parliament holden by <hi>Edwin</hi> K. of <hi>Northumberland</hi> the ſecond of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament holden by <hi>Segebert</hi> K. of the <hi>Eaſt Saxons,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they called their friends and their wiſe men: for <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine</hi> being inſtigated by <hi>Paulinus</hi> to imbrace the Chriſtian religion,<note place="margin">Beda Hiſt.

                  <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi> I <hi>Ethelſtane</hi> K. ſignifie to all my Governours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my Kingdome, that by the advice of <hi>Wulfhelmus</hi> my Arch-biſhop, and all my other Biſhops, and ſervants of God, for the forgiveneſſe of my ſins, I have ordained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And although lawes were frequently made,<note place="margin">Polydor. Virgil. lib. 11. Hiſt.</note> and Parliaments holden, in the Reigns of the <hi>Saxon Kings,</hi> yet the people had been ſo ſeldome called to ſuch conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, that <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> ſaith that inſtitution may ſeem to have ſprung from him. <hi>At illud appoſitè habeo dicere, Reges ante haec tempora non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueviſſe populi conventum conſultandi canſa (niſi perraro) fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, adeo ut ab</hi> Henrico <hi>id inſtitutum jure manaſſe dici poſſit. i. e.</hi> But this I can ſpeak appoſitively, that Kings before theſe times were not accuſtomed (except very ſeldome) to call the people to their conſultations, ſo that this inſtitution may be ſaid to have had its firſt beginning from King <hi>Henry.</hi> This is certain the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons hath been accuſtomed now a long time to give their conſent in making Lawes, but how long is not certain; their opinion is moſt likely which think this cuſtome began to take place about the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt. For there are probable reaſons which confirme, that Laws were made without the Concurrence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons long after the time of the aboveſaid <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, who, although he did call them more frequently then any of his predeceſſors had done, yet he did not bind himſelf to make laws alwayes by their aſſent. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:132567:39"/>it would requite anintire treatiſe to ſpeak ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this ſubject, and becauſe it can no way prejudice the cauſe in hand, if we grant Parliaments as they are now mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be by fundamental agreement, ſeeing the K. by the laws of the land, and the ſaid ſundamental agreement, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, as hath been ſhewed, with all the rights of Soverain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I will lay by many advantages, and omit many reaſons and paſſages which I could alledge touching this matter.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if the Nobility and people be then, and only then coordinate with the King, when they are in their <hi>ſite, relation, order,</hi> and <hi>union,</hi> in Parliament, as the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <hi>Anſwerer</hi> affirmeth; in time of Parliament the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhould be a <hi>Head</hi> without a <hi>Body:</hi> For if the King be part of the <hi>Head,</hi> and the whole Nobility part of the <hi>Head,</hi> and all the people part of the <hi>Head</hi> too, where is the <hi>Body?</hi> And on the other ſide in the vacancy of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Kingdome ſhould be a <hi>body</hi> without a <hi>Head:</hi> For if the Nobility and people be only coordinate when they are in their <hi>ſite, relation, order?</hi> and <hi>union</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after a Parliament be broken up, where is the <hi>Head?</hi> For as the preſervation of the whole conſiſt in the order and union of its parts, ſo the diſſolution of it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth their ſeperation and divorce. If this opinion then were true, the Common-wealth ſhould be a ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>Monſter,</hi> for in time of Parliament, when all the <hi>Body</hi> were a <hi>Head,</hi> it ſhould be monſtrous by too much perfection; and our of Parliament, when two parts of the <hi>Head</hi> were fallen into the <hi>Body,</hi> it ſhould be <hi>monſtrous</hi> by too little: In both caſes it ſhould want that beauty and comlineſſe which conſiſts in the harmony and proportion of ſeveral parts.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, if we deſcend into particulars, we ſhall find Parliaments to be ſo molded, that their frame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition rendereth the two houſes an unmeet ſubject for ſupreamacy; for the Militia, the power of making warre or peace with forrain princes, and moſt of the other rights of Soveraigntie, require a ſubject perpetually exiſtent;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:132567:40"/>many occaſionall accidents may ariſe that may call for preſent and ſudden uſe of the ſupreame power, for which there can be no proviſion made by bodies not exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent.</p>
               <p>Laſtly if the people collectively taken be Supreme and above their King, there ſhould be in every Kingdome of the world many Millions of Kings, namely, <hi>All the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> and theſe many Millions of Kings ſhould have but one Subject amongſt them all, namely, <hi>Their King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could adde much more, both from the ſtatutes, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, and reaſon, as well concerning the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in general, as concerning the particular rights of Soveraignty: But I preſume that which hath been ſaid is more then ſufficient, not only to ſatisfie all that are indifferent and neutral, but to convince thoſe that are moſt intereſſed, who ſhall not eaſily find ſhifts and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions plauſible enough to illude ſuch clear teſtimonies of law. But God only is able to change their hearts, and to make ſuch impreſſions there as can cauſe them to repent and turn from their evil wayes; I ſhall pray continually he would do it as well in regard of the peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Kingdome, as of their own ſalvation, which I cannot otherwiſe hope they ſhould obtain; For whatſoever deceives them, and bears up their ſpirits for a time, <hi>repentance at laſt,</hi> (if God give them grace) <hi>will prove their beſt fortune.</hi>

               <p>THE Kings Supremacy being made apparent I ſhall now proceed to anſwer their objections, which yet are of that nature that they deſerve more to be contemned then anſwered: for in ſtead of Law they alleadge <hi>Bedas</hi> axioms, their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and ſuch other impertinencies, as one would think ſhould ſooner move a man to laughter, then to be of their opinion. But becauſe they ſhall not complain that their objections are concealed, and becauſe in anſwering them I ſhall further confirm the Kings Supremacy, I will bring them all in order, not ſuppreſſing or omitting any thing that hath but the face of an objection, how ſlight and impertinent ſoever.

Lambart. Archaion fol. 95. <hi>I ſhall not need to repeat that which I have before this time opened, touching the beginning of the Kingly power and authority, for the delivery of juſtice
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:132567:41"/>to all the ſorts, and in all the ſuits of his ſubjects, but I will confirm by proofes drawn out of our country lawes and lawyers that the ſelf ſame generall juriſdiction is appropriated to all the Kings of this realm of England. Maſter</hi> Henry Bracton <hi>that lived in the time of King</hi> Henry <hi>the third hath in the ninth and tenth chapter of his book theſe words following:</hi> Rex (&amp; non alius) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet judicare, ſi ſolus ad id ſufficere poſſit, cum ad hoc per veritatem Sacramenti teneatur aſtrictus, exercere igitur de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Rex poteſtatem juris, ſicut Dei Vicarius &amp; miniſter in terra. Sin Dominus Rex ad ſingulas cauſas determinandas non ſufficiat, ut levior ſit illi labor in plures perſonaspartito onere, eligere debet viros ſapientes, &amp; timentes Deum, &amp; ex illis conſtituere juſticiarios. <hi>The words do prove two things ſerviceable to this purpoſe: firſt, that the K. onely is to be the judge of his people, if he alone were able to performe that office as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is within his own Kingdome the vice-Roy of God, (the ſupream judge of the world) as alſo for that he is thereunto bound by oath, taken at the Coronation. The ſecond that albeit he doe (for the multitude of cauſes) ſubſtitute others underneath him, yet is he not thereby diſcharged himſelf; for it is done</hi> ut levior ſit illi labor <hi>that his labour be the lighter, not that he ſhould ſit unoccupied; and leaſt you ſhould doubt that ſo much is not compriſed in that oath of his, one queſtion therein amongſt others is this:</hi> Facies fieri in omnibus judiciis tuis aequam, &amp; rectam juſtitiam, &amp; diſcretionem in miſericordia, &amp; veritate ſecundum vires tuas: <hi>To which he anſwereth,</hi> faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am: <hi>wherein the words</hi> judiciis tuis, &amp; vires tuas, <hi>doe more properly denote his own doing, then the doing of his ſubalterne juſtices; albeit their judgment be after a certain manner, the judgement of the King himſelf alſo, from whence their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is derived. Much like the words of</hi> Bracton <hi>ſpeaketh King</hi> Edward <hi>the firſt in the beginning of his book of law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called</hi> Britton: <hi>where after he had ſhewed that he is the Vicar of God. and that he hath diſtributed his charge into ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry portions, becauſe he alone is not ſufficient to heare and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all complaints of his people: theu he addeth theſe words</hi> Nous volons que noſtre juriſdiction ſo it ſur touts juriſdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:132567:42"/>en noſtre realm: iſſent que in touts manners de felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, treſpas, contracts, &amp; en touts maners de autres act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions perſonals, on real, ayons poer a rendre &amp; faire rendre les jugements tiels come ils, afferont, ſans a uter proceſſe, par la ou nous ſcavons la droit verite come judges. <hi>We Will,</hi> ſaith the King, <hi>that our own juriſdiction be above all the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of our realm: ſo as in all manner of felonies, treſpaſſes, contracts, and in all other actions perſonalls, or realls, we have power to yeild (or cauſe to yeild) ſuch judgements as do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (without other proceſſe) whereſoever we know the right truth, as judges. Neyther may this be taken to be meant of the Kings bench, where there is onely an imaginary preſence of his perſon; but it muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of a juriſdiction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining and left in the Kings Royall bodie and breaſt diſtinct from that of his Bench, Marſhalſey, Common pleas, Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. and the other ordinary courts: becauſe he doth immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, in the ſame place ſeverally ſet forth by themſelves, as well the authority of the Kings Bench, as of the reſt of thoſe his ordinarie Courts of juſtice. And that this was no new made law, or firſt brought in by the Normin conqueſt, I muſt put you in mind of that which I touched before, out of tho Saxon lawes of King Edgar, where you did read it thus:</hi> Nemo in lite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem appellato, niſi quando domi jus conſequi non pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſin juris ſummi onere domi prematur, ad regem ut is id oneris allevet, provocato: <hi>Let no man in ſuit appeale to the King unleſſe he may not get right at home; but if that right be to heavy for him, goe to ſhe King to have it eaſed. By which it may evidently appeare, that even ſo many years agoe there might appellation be made to the Kings Perſon, whenſoever the cauſe ſhould inforce it.</hi> Hitherto Mr. Lambart; who doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards further prove this ſupreame and ſupereminent juriſdiction of the King by divers precedents and acts of Parliament. And although the Commons in ſome other Parliaments have ſeemed to impugne this prerogative, yet here, as he ſaith,<note place="margin">Fol. 125.</note> 
                  <hi>the Kings alwayes moſt gravely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately repelled that ſort of attempt.</hi> The Kings ſupremacy then is inherent in his <hi>Perſon</hi> not in his <hi>Courts,</hi> as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:132567:42"/>Houſe affirm; for his politique capacity can not be ſeperated from his naturall, but what power ſoever he maketh over unto his <hi>Courts,</hi> the ſame and greater remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <hi>Himſelf;</hi> His authority is not ſeparated from him by ſuch a conceſſion <hi>privitivè</hi> but <hi>Cumulativè,</hi> onely as <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> diſtinguiſh in Conceſſions of like nature made by the <hi>Emperour,</hi> that is, He loſeth no authority by Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it to others, but others, hould that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated together with himſelf. As God loſeth no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by communicating it to Kings, ſo Kings loſeth it not by communicating of it to their Courts. The <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> give theſe reaſons for the ground of their law, not much different from thoſe alleadged by <hi>Lambart</hi> out of <hi>Bracton</hi> and others. <hi>Credendum non eſt Imperatorem ita fontes ſuos derivaſſe foras ut nihil penes ſe remanſerit; ſed in quavis conceſſione ſemper authoritas &amp; perſona ejus excepta cenſetur: quis enim tam ſtolidus ut alii benefaciendo ſeipſum conſumere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, cum etiam Principis ſit, &amp; ad offitium ejus proprie pertineat jus dicere Knichen. d. ſuperiorit. territ. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>num.</hi> 518. <hi>Wurmſ. evercit.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 15. <hi>Roſental. d. feud. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>concluſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Pruckman. d.

               <p>
                  <hi>THE Author of the Treatiſe of Monarchy, the fuller Anſwerer,</hi> and other <hi>Pretended Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,</hi> have invented a new form of Government to delude the People, which they tell them is the Government eſtabliſhed in <hi>England;</hi> namely, a <hi>mixed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> conſiſting of three Eſtates, independent for their authority upon one another, all of them being coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and having ſeveral ſhares in the rights of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, by the fundamental lawes of the land. A ſtrange kind of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> not ſo much as heard of until theſe times, much leſſe eſtabliſhed in <hi>England:</hi> for a <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> is the Government of <hi>one alone,</hi> as the Etymologie of the word importeth; now to ſay, the Government of <hi>three Eſtates,</hi> is the Government of <hi>one alone,</hi> doth not ſound half handſomely. Other Authors have ſpoken of <hi>mixed Government,</hi> and <hi>mixed Common-wealths,</hi> but of <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:132567:46"/>Monarchy</hi> in that ſenſe which they do, none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have treated. For according to the Verdict of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors,<note place="margin">Beſol. Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opſ. polit. doct. lib. 1. cap. 6.</note> when Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy, are melted and allayed together, that which reſulteth can take its name from none of the ſimple ſpecies or kinds of Government, although the chief authority, or primity of ſhare belong to any one of the eſtates. Yet if they will needs have a mixed Government to be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from that kind that hath predominancy, they might with better reaſon have called their new frame a mixed <hi>Democratie;</hi> this denomination (beſides that it is not ſo improper as the other, <hi>Democratie,</hi> implying the Government of the <hi>people,</hi> but not of the <hi>people only,</hi> as Monarchy doth of the <hi>Monarch alone</hi>) is more agreeable to the quality and nature of their platforme; for the Kings authority being ſo inconſiderable as they make it, the people in this mixture muſt needs be the predominant Element. The Author of the <hi>Treatiſe of Monarchy</hi> who ſeemeth to give moſt to the King, although in terms he grants him a <hi>primity of ſhare</hi> in the ſupreme powet, yet in ſubſtance he would have it placed in the two Houſes, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing unto them ſuch authority, as they may thereby make him deprivable at their pleaſure. Now although the ſaid <hi>Treatiſer</hi> ſeemeth to be a <hi>Poet</hi> rather then a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,</hi> having many new fictions, but ſcarcely a word of law in all his treatiſe, yet becauſe I cannot conveniently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his objections to any of the other Queſtions that are hereafter to be diſcuſſed, I will anſwer them in this place: But before I come to examine them, that all things may be clear, and better underſtood, I will, for perſpicuity ſake, ſpeak a word or two of the diviſion and ſeveral kinds of <hi>Abſolute, Limited,</hi> and <hi>Mixed</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>I will begin with <hi>Abſolute</hi> Government, of which there be three kinds; the firſt is <hi>Abſolute</hi> both in reſpect of power, and alſo in reſpect of the uſe and exerciſe of it. In this kind of Government the Supreme Governours have perfect, <hi>Abſolute,</hi> full and intire power; and in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:132567:47"/>exerciſe of it are ſubject to no limitation made by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane law, paction or agreement, but are limited <hi>ab externo</hi> by the lawes of God and nature onely, being otherwiſe left to the free determination of their owne wills. This is alſo called <hi>Arbitrary</hi> government, not becauſe ſuch governours as have the free uſe of their power may doe what they pleaſe; for their power is bounded by the lawes of God and nature, and may not tranſgreſſe and goe beyond its limits: but becauſe it is not bounded by any humane poſitive law made to reſtraine and regulate it. The ends of Government may be attained ſeverall wayes in many particulars with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of the Lawes of God and nature; now when a Governour is not directed to his end in any of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars by humane conſtitution and appointment, but hath an open and free paſſage to act which way he pleaſe, his Government is <hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary.</hi> Amongſt all the ſeverall kindes of Government this onely is <hi>jure Divino,</hi> as being more ancient then any humane law that could be made to direct it, by virtue and authority whereof, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes were at firſt enacted; all other ſorts were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the policy of men, yet lawfull, humane Conſtitutions ſerving to conduct power to its end; mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were a furrow, for it to paſſe in, and to contain it, which otherwiſe is apt to overflow its bounds, and to degenerate into tyranny. The ſecond is <hi>Abſolute</hi> in reſpect of the power alone; In this kind of Government the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governours have as perfect, <hi>Abſolute,</hi> full, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire power as the former, their authority have the ſame latitude, and all the ſame dimenſions; but they are limited <hi>ab externo</hi> in the uſe and exerciſe of it, either by originall and fundamentall conſtitution, or elſe by lawes made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by ſpeciall grace and condeſcention: ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their power be perfect, <hi>Abſolute,</hi> full and intire, in all reſpects, and able to produce all the effects of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, yet they can not put it forth, and act by it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own free election, or according to the full activity of it, but muſt act according to thoſe limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:132567:47"/>made and granted by law. The third is <hi>Abſolute</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the exerciſe onely; In this kind of Government the exerciſe of the ſupreme authority is committed for a certain time, but the ſupreme authority it ſelf not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, to one or more, who by virtue of the ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion may exerciſe the power in an <hi>arbitrary</hi> manner dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time aſſigned them. Such were the <hi>Dictators</hi> of the <hi>Romane Commonwealth,</hi> who ruled as <hi>arbitrarily</hi> all the time of their <hi>Dictatorſhip,</hi> as the moſt <hi>Abſolute</hi> Monarchs in the world, yet the ſupreme authority remained in the <hi>Senate:</hi> And ſuch are they who exerciſe Royal power in the minority of Princes, whoſe Government is <hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are alſo three kindes of <hi>Limited</hi> Government an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereable to Abſolute; the firſt is <hi>Limited</hi> both in reſpect of Power, and alſo in reſpect of the uſe and exerciſe of it; In this kind of Government there are alwayes more Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours then one, which are all <hi>Limited</hi> in the very eſſence and being of their power, having none of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, abſolute, full and intire authority, but onely their ſeverall ſhares and proportion: neither can they act in an arbitrary manner according to the full extent of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which they have, but have a certain rule ſet them by law. The ſecond is <hi>Limited</hi> in reſpect of the power alone; In this kinde of Government as in the former, there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes more Governours then own, which have all their <hi>Limited</hi> ſhares, yet may all act arbitrarily either joyntly together, or every one within the <hi>pale</hi> and <hi>limits</hi> of his own authority. The third is <hi>Limited</hi> in reſpect of the exerciſe onely; In this kind of Government, the Governours are abſolute in regard of power, but circumſcribed and Limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Acts of it.</p>
               <p>As of abſolute and limited ſo there are likewiſe three kinds of <hi>Mixed</hi> Government ſutable to the other; the firſt is <hi>Mixed</hi> both in reſpect of power, and alſo in reſpect of the uſe and exerciſe of it. In this kinde of Government there is a mixture of ſeverall powers which compound and make
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:132567:48"/>up one perfect, abſolute, full and intire power; and alſo of ſeverall perſons and eſtates, to whom the ſaid powers do radically and fundamentally pertain, which do jointly concurre in the adminiſtration and exerciſe of them. The Second is <hi>Mixed</hi> in reſpect of the power alone; In this kind of Government ſeverall perſons and eſtates are mixed together in the poſſeſſion of power, but one alone do exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe all the acts of Soveraigntie. In this manner was the <hi>Roman Commonwealth</hi> governed by <hi>Sylla;</hi> and by <hi>Dictators</hi> in the time of exigence and neceſſity. The third is <hi>Mixed</hi> in reſpect of the exerciſe onely; In this kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeverall perſons and eſtates are <hi>Mixed</hi> in the exerciſe of power, but one of the eſtates alone hath the dominion, and propriety of it.</p>
               <p>Now touching the Government of <hi>England,</hi> I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already that it is Monarchicall, that the Monarchie is <hi>Abſolute,</hi> in reſpect of the power; that the King alone hath perfect, <hi>Abſolute,</hi> full and intire juriſdiction, able if put in action, to effectuate, and bring to paſſe, all the ends of Government: and that all other perſons, of all eſtates and degrees whatſoever, both Nobles, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, move in their ſeverall circuits and ſpheres of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ivity, by virtuall emanation from him, and not by force of any power, authority, or juriſdiction inherent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And indeed all Monarchies are <hi>Abſolute</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; that is, in reſpect of the power, for when the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is in the eſſence and being of power, Monarchie is deſtroyed, not limited.</p>
               <p>But yet the Engliſh Monarchie is <hi>Limited</hi> in reſpect of the uſe and exerciſe of power, the King being obliged to govern according to the laws of the land, which although they doe not diminiſh Majeſty <hi>in eſſentialibus,</hi> yet they do diverſly qualifie, and modificate it. It is alſo <hi>Mixed</hi> in the ſame reſpect, the King being obliged in ſome caſes not to uſe his power without the aſſent and concurrence of the two other eſtates. The pretended Parliamentarians, on the other ſide, deny the Engliſh Monarchie to be <hi>Abſolute</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:132567:48"/>in any reſpect; and affirm it to be <hi>Limited</hi> and <hi>Mixed,</hi> as well in reſpect of the power it ſelf, as in reſpect of the uſe and exerciſe thereof, the two Houſes of Parliament being coordinate with the King, not only in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of power, but in the poſſeſſion of it. Yet they are not able to alledge one ſyllable of law to make good theſe ſtrange novelties, but ſtrive by indirect inferences to decieve the people. Howſoever I will bring their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, ſuch as they are, and anſwer them in order: and firſt I will bring their objections whereby they indevour to prove their pretended limitation, and then thoſe whereby they endevour to prove their pretended mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  </label> Before I come to anſwer his objections, out of his own mouth will I condemn him; for if he be perſwaded, as he ſaith in his firſt objection, that the King by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell knew the nature of his own power beſt, why hath he acted contrary to his Majeſties Declarations? why hath he, againſt his conſcience, affirmed it to be lawful to take up arms againſt him? he knows his Majeſty was never of that opinion. Now, to his objections I ſay that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and fifth, proceed upon his own principles, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> is mixed in the power it ſelf, and that the Legiſlative power is not in the King alone, but jointly in the three eſtates: If theſe principles were true, his objections were material; but I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the contrary, and ſhall yet ſhew it further hereafter. In his other three objections he doth not ſo much as touch the queſtion propounded; he layeth down this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:132567:49"/>to be proved, <hi>that the Kings Soveraignty is radically and fundamentally Limited, and not only in the uſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it,</hi> but endevoureth to prove no more then that it is limited in general, without ſpecifying whether radical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in the eſſence and being of it, or in the exerciſe only. A Legal moderation and limitation of Royal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as far as I know, is denyed by none, although the Treatiſer be pleaſed to lay a falſe imputation upon ſome Divines, becauſe they hold it not limited in the ſame manner which he hath repreſented it: The Kings Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty to be radically and fundamentally limited, and not only in the uſe and exerciſe of it, is, in the ſenſe by him explained, to be ſo limited, that his Majeſty ſhall not only be reſtrained in the uſe and exerciſe of ſupreme power, but ſhall alſo be ſtinted in his ſhare of it, and have no more then a ſingle part, two other parts of the ſaid power belonging to the other eſtates. Now, that he may deceive the people, he maketh a ſhew as if he had gained his purpoſe by proving the Kings power to be limited in general, whereas he knoweth well enough that there is a great difference between being limited, and being ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by law. The Kings power to be <hi>meaſured</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> by law, includes no more then that his power is of ſuch a ſize and bigneſſe as the law hath ordained; if the law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him perfect, abſolute, full, and intire power, and limits him only in the exerciſe of it, this is a reſtraint and limitation according to law, yet not in the eſſence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of power. And indeed this is the true and only limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Monarchy, whereby the Monarchs power is limited <hi>ab externo</hi> by humane lawes and conſtitutions, and not by the free and arbitrary reſolutions of his own will, and yet Monarchy preſerved intire. But when the rights of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty are divided and placed in ſeveral Eſtates which limit one another, ſuch a limitation is inconſiſtent with Monarchy. But the Treatiſer objecteth further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt this anſwer, that where the limitation of power is only in the exerciſe of it and not in the power it ſelf
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:132567:50"/>all acts of Government are reſolved at laſt into the arbitrary will of the Monarch: for although he be limited in the exerciſe of power by Law, or promiſe, yet if he will contrary to Law and Promiſe ſinfully put it forth, his power is authoritative and may not be reſiſted: this is the full ſcope and ſumme of that which he replyeth to Doctor <hi>Fern</hi> with no ſmall oſtentation. <hi>A Legal reſtraint,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> ſaith he, <hi>you ſeem to acknowledge; but ſuch an one as reſolve into the aobitrary Will of the Monarch, as I have made it appear in my former Treatiſe, which you will never be able to wipe off by this or any other reply.</hi> If this Reply were ſtrictly examined, it would appear far unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſuch boaſts and brags as are brought to ſet it out; but I ſhall only in brief ſhew the inſufficiency of it, and ſo let it paſſe. Firſt, therefore I ſay that we do by this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more reſolve Monarchy then he reſolves his mixed Common-wealth, into an arbitrary Government. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in a mixed government every one of the eſtates hath but a limited ſhare, yet taken together they have perfect, abſolute, full, and intire power, which if they will contrary to law or promiſe ſinfully put forth, it is as authoritative and unreſiſtible as if it were in one man. He will grant, I ſuppoſe, the power of government to be equal in all Common-wealths, and that there can be no eſſential but only an accidental difference between them, for all Common-wealths have a ſufficiency of power to attain to all the ends of government, and to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for all occurrencies, which cannot be otherwiſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited then in the exerciſe: This he confeſſeth in another place; for diſputing about the limitation of power in the eſſence and being thereof, and having made an objection againſt it, in anſwering the objection he ſaith, <hi>ſuch a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation cannot be where power is ſupreme, but for limitation to a rule and defined way of working,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>I cannot ſee how it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the end of Government,</hi> which is the ſame in other terms that he confutes in Doctor <hi>Fern,</hi> and doth expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude that the power of Government taken <hi>in ſua
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:132567:50"/>latitudine</hi> can not be limited in the eſſence and being of it, but in the uſe and exerciſe only; for, to be limited to a rule and defined way of working, is to be limited in the exerciſe, but not in the eſſence of power. If then allacts of government are reſolved into the arbitrary will of the governours where the limitation of power is only in the exerciſe of it, doth he not himſelf reſolve his mixed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth into an arbitrary Government? But ſecondly, I ſay, that to limit power in the exerciſe of it, is ſo far from reſolving all caſes into the arbitrary will of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, that it is the only way and means to reſtrain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarineſſe; the limitation of power in the eſſence and being of it alone, is not ſufficient to reſtrain it; for when power is limited in its eſſence and being, and terminated only within its own intrinſinque bounds, ſuch a limitation is oppoſed to an <hi>Infinite,</hi> but not to an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> activity. When the three Eſtates have all their limited ſhares, yet they may all act <hi>arbitrarily</hi> according to the extent of that power which they have, not only when they act jointly together, but in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſeveral charges, if their power be not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by law in the exerciſe of it; it is not the limitation of power therefore in the eſſence and being of it, but in the exerciſe, which denominates and conſtitutes a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Government. Power which is limited in the eſſence and being of it only, although it cannot act <hi>arbitrarily</hi> in ſo great a latitude as when it is intire and abſolute, yet it may act <hi>arbitrarily</hi> within its own bounds if it be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only by the will of him that acteth by it, and not by a certain rule of law. Beſides the former objections, the Treatiſer in his reply to Doctor <hi>Fern</hi> hath added others which proceed upon one of their own principles, namely that all authority and power is originally in the people, from whence he inferreth that they may tranſlate as much and as little, as they pleaſe to their governours, and ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their power in its being and eſſence. But becauſe they ſpeak not <hi>de facto</hi> but <hi>de poſſibili,</hi> and becauſe I ſhall han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

                  </label> His Majeſty acknowledgeth Monarchy to be ſo mixed with Ariſtocracy and Democracy in the exerciſe of ſome part of his power, that the conveniencies of all thoſe forms of Government, without the inconveniencies of any of them, are obtained by ſuch a mixture; But he denyeth the mixture to be in the power it ſelf, for the convenience which he ſaith it hath from Monarchy, is, that it is Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by <hi>one Head:</hi> Where by <hi>one Head,</hi> he meaneth not <hi>one</hi> by mixture, but <hi>one</hi> ſingle Perſon, <hi>one</hi> pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed ſubject, that hath all power and authority alone. The Treatiſer, I conceive, hath purpoſely omitted his words, that his ſenſe might not appear; but I ſhall cite them in the next chapter, and ſhew the true intention and meaning of them. Now, whereas his Majeſty hath acknowledged a mixture, to infer from thence that he granted the mixture to be in the power it ſelf, becauſe the other kind is not a true, but an improper kind of mixture, is a ſtrange and unuſual way of argumentation. If his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was in an errour, and apprehended that to be a true mixture, which is not, all that can be concluded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:132567:51"/>is, that he miſunderſtood the true nature of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not that he granted the mixture to be ſuch as they contend for, when it is evident that a man deny a thing <hi>in terminis,</hi> there is neither candor nor ingenuity in thoſe, which will by conſequences argue him to affirm it: Some accuſe the <hi>Romane Catholiques of Idolatry,</hi> becauſe they affirm ſuch things, as in their conceit ſeem by way of conſequence to allow it, but no man was ever ſo void of ingenuity as to diſpute the queſtion whether <hi>Idolatry be lawful,</hi> and then cite them for <hi>Authors</hi> that maintain it to be lawful: In like manner ſome accuſe <hi>Calvine</hi> of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme,</hi> becauſe he affirm ſuch things, as in their conceit ſeem by way of conſequence to juſtifie the practiſe and religion of the <hi>Turks;</hi> but no man was ever ſo unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as to diſpute the Queſtion <hi>whether the Turkiſh religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be the true Religion,</hi> and then cite him for an <hi>Author</hi> that maintained it to be true; becauſe it is evident that if thoſe queſtions were propounded <hi>in terminis,</hi> the <hi>Romane Catholicks</hi> would deny <hi>Idolatry to be lawful;</hi> and <hi>Calvine,</hi> if he were alive, <hi>the Turkiſh religion to be the true religion,</hi> what conſequences ſoever other men draw from their words. Yet the <hi>Treatiſer</hi> dealeth in this manner with his Majeſty, for although it be evident, that his Majeſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, <hi>in terminis,</hi> the mixture of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy <hi>to be in the power it ſelf,</hi> yet he argues him by conſequences to affirm it: this to the Antecedent. But ſecondly, the conſequent is alſo falſe; the miſtake is in himſelf, not in his Majeſty: why is it no mixture, which is not in the root and ſupremacy of power? he anſwereth, <hi>Though it hath a ſubordination of inferiour officers, and though the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers inferiour be ſeated in a mixed ſubject, yet that makes it not a mixed Government; for it is compatible to the ſimpleſt in the world to have ſubordinate mixtures:</hi> What if no govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world be ſo perfectly ſimple as to exclude all ſubordinate mixtures? it doth not follow from thence, that a ſubordinate mixture is no mixture. I ſhall alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the very ground and foundation of his argument;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:132567:52"/>ſuch ſubordinate mixtures, as are in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy, are not compatible to the ſimpleſt government in the world; for where the government is arbitrary and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute both in reſpect of power, and in reſpect alſo of the uſe and exerciſe of it, ſupreme governours can put forth all the acts of power and juriſdiction alone; they can make lawes, raiſe taxes, and exerciſe their whole power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the full activity of it, without the concurrence of the other eſtates: and although they do often make uſe of their direction and aſſiſtance; yet this mixture in the exerciſe of power proceeds not from the conſtitution of government, but from their own voluntary election, chooſing this as the moſt conducible means to obtain the ends of government. For although they may act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the full activity of their power, yet they cannot act in perſon at all times and in all places, nor is one mans wiſdome ſufficient to meet with all the Events and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of government, by reaſon whereof they are driven to ſeek a remedy againſt ſuch inconveniencies as would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe frm theſe and the like cauſes; and if, when they find no better they ſubſtitute others and give them authority to act with them in the exerciſe of power, this voluntary mixture cannot have ſuch an effect as to denominate a government mixed, becauſe it depend upon the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate will of the ſupreme governour, who may act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, where and when he pleaſe: and whether he acts with them, or without them, the frame of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſtill the ſame; for it is the conſtitution of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that ſpecificate it, and cauſeth it to be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated mixed, or ſimple. There is a great difference then between ſuch ſubordinate mixtures, and the ſubordinate dinate mixture that is in the Engliſh Monarchie, thoſe are mutable, uncertain, depending upon the will of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour; this immutable, certain, depending upon the conſtitution of the Government: for whether it was effected by originall contract with the people at the firſt foundation of the Monarchy, or whether it was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed afterward by the voluntary grant and conceſſion of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:132567:52"/>ſome of our Kings, or whether it was introduced by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, the Government is now ſo conſtituted, that the King can not make lawes, raiſe ſubſidies, or exerciſe ſome other acts of his power, without the aſſent of the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſtates; So that the very conſtitution of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is mixed in ſome reſpect, namely in reſpect of the exerciſe of ſome acts of power, which happeneth not in Common-wealths where the government is arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

If that were true, yet a mixed form of Government may proceed from the mixture of ſeveral perſons, and eſtates; for forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are no acts. Beſides, the Diviſion of Government into ſimple and mixed, is made in reſpect of the Perſons, and Eſtates, not of the power, which remains the ſame under all formes and changes of Government, and cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>&amp; per ſe,</hi> but improperly <hi>&amp; per accidens</hi> be ſaid to be mixed; for it is mixed onely <hi>ad mixtionem ſubjecti,</hi> when it is ſeated in a mixed ſubject, being otherwiſe the ſame that it is in a ſimple: and when a ſimple form of Government is changed into a mixed, or a mixed into a ſimple, the power ſuffereth not the leaſt alteration, but is denominated ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or mixed, according as it is ſeated in a ſimple or mixed ſubject. This is the Common aſſertion of all Authors, who do generally teach the diverſity of Common-wealths to arife from the diverſity of Perſons, their ſimplicity and mixture, from the ſimplicity and mixture of Perſons, and eſtates; not from the diverſity, or from the ſimplicity

Now where the ſeverall forms of government are totally mixed, that is, where the mixture of the three Eſtates is both in the power and in the exerciſe of it, there the ſimple forms of government are corrupted, and that which reſults out of their mixture and corruption is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form diſtinct from them all; which by authors is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally called a <hi>mixed Common-wealth:</hi> this kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is always Polyarchicall, ſuch a mixture being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible to Monarchie.

This is a light mixture in compariſon of the other, but as great as is conſiſtent with any of the ſimple forms of government, and as true a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the former; which although it doth not totally corrupt, yet it doth manifeſtly allay the ſimplicity of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: for where ſeverall eſtates have intereſt by the conſtitution of a government in the exerciſe of power, the government is not ſo ſimple, as where one of the eſtates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone have all the intereſt.</p>

I ſhall not need to inſtance in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, or in other Kingdomes, for it is generally known that ſuch a mixture was in that, and hath been, and is, in moſt other Monarchies.

Why doth not the <hi>Treatiſer</hi> and the Pretended Parliamentarians conclude from hence that every man is coordinate with the King in the rights of Soveraignty? for this is done by the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power, and this authority they have by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly I anſwer to the conſequent, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power is not radically in the three eſtates, but in the King alone; for although their aſſent be free and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not upon his will, yet their authority is derived from him: he ſhould have proved his conſequent, which he ſaith appeareth in the former queſtion, where indeed he doth confidently affirm the <hi>whole latitude of the Nomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical power to be jointly in the three eſtates,</hi> yet offereth not to prove it. But there is ſcarcely any man in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo much a ſtranger to the Laws, but knows that the King alone hath power to diſpence with the Statutes, and to abate their rigour where a miſchief would otherwiſe inſue; that he alone hath power by edicts and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:132567:55"/>to order all affairs for which there is no order taken by certain and perpetual laws; that he with his Judges hath power to declare the meaning of the Law, and to give an authentick interpretation to ſtatutes of ambiguous and doubtful ſenſe. The King can exerciſe theſe and all other parts of the Nomothetical power which are of abſolute neceſſity to government without the aſſent of the two houſes, whoſe concurrence is only neceſſary in making laws which ſhall bind poſterity, and may not be repealed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the people, as well as of the King. The whole latitude therefore of the Nomothetical power is not jointly in the three Eſtates, but the power on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of making certain and perpetual Lawes; and when ſuch laws are made it is the Kings authority that gives life unto them, they having otherwiſe no power to obleige the conſcience then as they are his Commands. This hath been ſufficiently confirmed already, yet I will here further illuſtrate the truth by the teſtimonies of<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Bracton</hi> and the Author of<note n="b" place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Fleta,</hi> who applying that paſſage of the Civil Law, <hi>Quod Principi placet legis habet poteſtatem,</hi> to the King of <hi>England,</hi> ſay, <hi>That clauſe ought not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of every thing that is raſhly preſumed to be his will, but of that which is juſtly determined upon good advice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation by the Councel of his Magiſtrates, Rege Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem praeſtante, the King giving it Authority, and confirming it for a law:</hi> and from hence by an argument <hi>ab indecoro,</hi> they ſhew that the King ought not to do unjuſtly, <hi>Cum ipſe ſit Author juris non debet inde Injuriarum naſci occaſio, unde jura naſcuntur,</hi> When he himſelf is the Author of the Law, injuſtice ought not to ſpring from the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from whence the Law doth ſpring. The Legiſlative power is in the King therefore as in its ſpring and fountain, and in the other eſtates by derivation; they have right and intereſt in the uſe and exerciſe of ſome parts of the power, and may aſſent or diſſent what ſhall be made a Law, but the power it ſelf is radically in him.</p>
               <p>Now the Legiſlative power is either <hi>Architectonical</hi> or
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:132567:56"/>
                  <hi>preceptive:</hi> the Architectonical power is that which lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the materials of a Law, and it conſiſteth in two things. Firſt, in determining what is <hi>juſt, convenient,</hi> or <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;</hi> they to whom this power is committed, have no juriſdiction granted them, but only and office and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deliberate and conſult. Secondly, in declaring and promulgating that to be actually made a law and enacted, which upoo conſultation is thought to be <hi>juſt, convenient,</hi> or <hi>neceſſary;</hi> they to whom this power is committed; have a juriſdiction granted them to define authoritatively what ſhall be a law. The preceptive power is that which maketh the law ſacred and inviolable, and which giveth it force to oblige the conſcience. It is evident by that which have bin ſaid that not the preceptive, but the exerciſe only of the <hi>Architectonical</hi> power is committed to the two houſes, they have <hi>votum conſultivum &amp; deciſivum</hi> both authority to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult what is <hi>juſt, convenient,</hi> or <hi>neceſſary;</hi> and alſo to decree what ſhall be made a law: but this authority is derived from the King.<note place="margin">Pag. 39.</note> The Treatiſer in his reply to Dr. <hi>Fern</hi> ſeemeth to be unſatisfied with this anſwer &amp; doth there diſpute againſt it after this manner, <hi>my ſecond argument</hi> ſaith he <hi>for radicall mixture, is from the Legiſlative power being in all three: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,</hi> that phraſe is ſatisfied and explained by that conncur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and conſent in the exerciſe of ſupreme power. <hi>It ſeems that invention of his muſt ſerve all turns is a legiſlative power ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by a bare powerleſſe conſent? I demand is that conſent cauſal and authoritative? or meerly conſiliarie and unauthoritative? And whereas I prove that they have an enacting authority by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and ſet clauſe in the beginning of acts;</hi> Be it enacted by the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty, and the authority of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament. <hi>He tell us a vote and power of aſſenting is a great authority, I enquire not how great it is: I aske whether that be all; whether that clauſe, which as expreſſely as words can, aſſcribes an enacting authority to them, be ſatisfied by ſuch a power of aſſenting.</hi> Here are many words heaped together, yet not ſo much as one that toucheth the preſent controverſie: the queſtion is not,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:132567:56"/>whether the two Houſes have authority, nor yet whether they have an enacting authority; it is evident they could not ſit as Judges in the court without authority, nor enact without an enacting authority: but the queſtion is, firſt, whether their enacting authority ſpoken of in the foreſaid clauſe be onely a power of aſſenting that ſuch or ſuch a law ſhall be eſtabliſhed, or a power that Commandeth and giveth life and vigour to the laws: Secondly, whether this power be radically in themſelves or derived from the King. To the firſt I ſay that it is onely a power of aſſenting;<note place="margin">7 H. 7.14. &amp; 11. H. 7.25.</note> for it hath bin reſolved by the judges that this clauſe which he alledgeth, <hi>Be it enacted by the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty, and the authority of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lambarts Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheion f. 271.</note> is no more in ſubſtance and effect then that which was uſed anciently, <hi>The King, with the aſſent of the Lord and Commons, eſtabliſheth,</hi> the words <hi>aſſenteth</hi> &amp; <hi>enacteth</hi> being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent in this caſe. And to the ſecond I ſay that their authority is derived from the King, not radically in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; For although this <hi>Treatiſer</hi> knows not, or will not ſeem to know how to put a difference between having an enacting authority, and having the Legiſlative authority radically in themſelves, yet the Judges did, and others doe: For they may enact by a delegate authority, that is, by having the uſe and exerciſe of the Legiſlative power committed to them ſo far as is neceſſary to that act, although it be not radically in them as their own. But now the Treatiſer Speaketh not a word to either of theſe points, but ſheweth onely that they have an enacting au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which is a point not controverted. For their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of aſſenting and laying the materialls of a law, is an enacting power, although their activity be not equall to the Kings; Subordinate Agents that are but Inſtruments of an other, and work by a derived power, when they concurre with the principall and ſupreme agent have their cauſality in producing the effect. And therefore whereas he demandeth whether <hi>their conſent be cauſall and authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or meerly conſiliary and unauthoritative?</hi> I anſwer that it is as cauſall and authoritative as if the legiſlative power
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:132567:57"/>were radically in themſelves, for he that worketh with an other mans tools is as much the cauſe of the work as if the tools he uſeth were his own; whether the authority by which they enact be the Kings, or radically in themſelves, the effect will be the ſame.</p>
               <p>It may be further objected that theſe words, <hi>Be it enacted by the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty, and the authority of the Lords &amp; Commons aſſembled in Parliament,</hi> do imply diſtinct autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, the authority of the K. and the authority of the Lords and commons; for theadition of theſe words, <hi>And the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Lords &amp; Commons,</hi> is improper, if lawes be enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Kings authority alone. To this I anſwer; firſt, that there is nothing more frequent when the K. acteth jointly with his ſubordinate Miniſters, then to aſcribe a concurrent authority to thoſe that act with him, although their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be derived from him: for although his authority cannot be ſeperated from him <hi>privativè</hi> as hath been ſaid, yet <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulativè</hi> it may, that is, it may be inherent in his own Perſon, and yet be in others too, as the light of the Sun is inherent in its own body, and yet multiplyed and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the world; Now when it is ſeparated from him after that manner, it is commonly called their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to whom it is committed, becauſe they are the ſeat and ſubject of it. That light which the Stares derive from the Sun is uſually called the light of the Stars, and the Stars are ſaid by the means thereof to concurre with the Sun, and to have a cauſality and operation upon inferiour bodies; it is no impropriety to ſay, The light of the Sun and the light of the Stars inlightneth all the world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the light of the Stars be derived from the Sun. But ſecondly, what if it be granted that the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons have authority of their own diſtinct from the Kings authority? To ſpeak my own opinion freely, I think they have a diſtinct authority, I mean not Supreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but an authority derived from the King, yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from his. He that hath but a delegate power, if it be committed to him for term of years, term of life or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:132567:57"/>he doth by ſuch a grant acquire an eſtate in the ſaid power, and an authority diſtinct from his that gave it him. As in an Eſtate of lands wherein a man hath a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall right in fee ſimple, or in fee taile, his right is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the Kings right of whom he holds it, the King having the demeane of the <hi>Land,</hi> and the other the demeane of the <hi>Fee:</hi> ſo it is in an eſtate of power, and authority; if the King granteth an eſtate of power, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and juriſdiction, in fee ſimple, or in fee taile, for term of years, term of life, or perpetuity, their rights in the ſaid authority are diſtinct; the King hath the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean of the <hi>Power,</hi> the other the demean of the <hi>uſe,</hi> the King hath <hi>Dominium directum</hi> the other <hi>Dominum utile.</hi> And this is the preſent caſe; the Legiſlative power is wholely and intirely the Kings, yet the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons have a perpetual right in the uſe and exerciſe of ſome part thereof, ſo that the King cannot actually make a law, except they will alſo uſe the authority committed to them, it being in their power to aſſent or not aſſent, to uſe or not to uſe, the ſaid authority. There is an authority then in the Lords and Commons diſtinct from the Kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which muſt neceſſarily be put forth in the making of lawes, yet not ſupreme, but ſubordinate to the King, derived from him, and depending upon him. But this is more then can be forced out of the foreſaid clauſe, and I think more then is intended in it.</p>

But the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> hath neither apparence nor ſhadow of truth; Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ordained, that the other eſtates might conſult with the King about the weighty affairs of the Kingdome as often as he thought it needfull, and agree to ſuch laws as ſhould be found profitable and expedient: not that they ſhould quarrell and conteſt with him. It is true the two Houſes do for the moſt part in time of Parliament gain an opportunity to have grievances redreſſed, becauſe they may otherwiſe deny the King the aſſiſtance he deſire; but they have no authority radically in themſelves to redreſſe them or to reſtrain and moderate his exceſſes by force of armes; nor were they conſtituted for that end: If it ſhould be granted that Parliaments are by originall conſtitution and agreement, and that the People have alwayes given what lawes they pleaſed to the <hi>Conquerour</hi> as often as the Crown hath been obtained by <hi>conqueſt;</hi> yet in probability they could have no ſuch end as this <hi>Treatiſer</hi> imagineth, or to abuſe the people, ſeemeth to imagine: had they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the three eſtates, ſhould moderate the exceſſes of one another in Parliaments, they would never have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King authority to diſſolve them at his pleaſure, whereby he might eaſily avoyd and fruſtrate their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Beſides Parliaments are ſo tempered as it is impoſible to attain to that end by ſuch a mixture; one of the eſtates, or any two of them, having no authority to make an act of Parliament without the third, which way can they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the exceſſes of one another by ſuch acts further then the exorbitant eſtate ſhall be willing to be moderated? Nor doth his Majeſty, as he imputeth to him, any where confeſſe that <hi>three eſtates are conſtituted in this Monarchie to the end that the power of one ſhould moderate and reſtrain from exceſſe the power of the other,</hi> he ſhould therefore have cited his words, that the Reader might have judged of their ſenſe.</p>

               <p> Theſe are the objections, brought by the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Treatiſe of Monarchy,</hi> which are partly taken out of the <hi>fuller Anſwerer,</hi> and partly invented by himſelf. In anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, to avoyd needleſſe Controverſies, I have granted that a mixed form of government is poſſible, although I be not ignorant that a mixed government is but the invention of later times, and reputed impoſſible by authors of chiefeſt note. I have admitted alſo that the King, the Nobility, and Commons, are the three eſtates of Parliament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I know this contrary to the Statutes, wherein the three Eſtates of Parliament are declared to be the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and the <hi>Commons.</hi> I have inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the longer upon theſe Objections, becauſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the foreſaid Treatiſe is eſteemed by ſome the chief Advocate of that ſide. I intend not to derogate from the Author, who I preſume would have written more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially had the caſe been capable of defence; yet if a man may gueſſe at his humour by that Treatiſe, he ſeemeth to be much more inclined to aſſert new principles, then to ſhew reaſons how they ſhould be maintained. That he might il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the Laws wherein the government of <hi>England</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Monarchical, he layeth down divers poſitions to this effect, that where a <hi>tranſcendent intereſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Part 1. cap. 4.</note> or <hi>primity of ſhare,</hi> is in one man, it is ſufficient to conſtitute a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, although the other eſtates have their ſhares alſo in the rights of Soveraignty, and ſupreme Authority; but he doth not ſo much as offer to prove this either by law or reaſon, although it be contrary to the Common received principles of other Authors, who teach that ſuch a <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent intereſt</hi> or <hi>primity of ſhare</hi> cannot make a Monarch. For ſuch a <hi>preheminence</hi> is in ſome perſons in the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular States, as in the Dukedomes of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genna,</hi>

Again, that he might illude the Laws wherein the King is declared to be <hi>Supreme,</hi> he ſaith that a <hi>tranſcendent intereſt,</hi> or <hi>utmoſt Chiefty,</hi> is ſufficient to make good that <hi>title;</hi> yet he endevoureth not to confirm this by one inſtance, although it be contrary to the received ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word when it hath reference to power and juriſdiction: for in Law when a governour or Ruler is called <hi>Supreme,</hi> the word <hi>Supreme</hi> is alwayes oppoſed to <hi>ſubordinate</hi> and not to <hi>leſſe:</hi> amongſt Lawyers he ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten find power and juriſdiction divided into <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>ſubordinate,</hi> but never into <hi>Supreme,</hi> and <hi>leſſe,</hi> if that which is <hi>leſſe</hi> be alſo <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>independent.</hi> But yet if his new principles were granted to be true, he cannot by ſuch ſhifts, in any plauſible manner evade the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, wherein the King is declared to have intire, whole, and plenary power, and to be ſo ſupreme that all authority is derived from him, and wherein it is declared that all obedience is due to him, and to him only: Will a tranſcendent intereſt make good all this? Is a Primity of Share intire, whole and plenary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Can all authority be derived from him that hath but an utmoſt chiefly? Is all obedience due to one of the Eſtates, where the mixture is in the power it ſelf, and ſupreme authority radically in the other? Surely if the other Eſtates have Power, Allegiance and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is due unto it; they had as good challenge no power, as challenge no obedience.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Divers generall objections taken from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his <hi>Majeſty, Bracton,</hi> and <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> together with the Precedents of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, anſwered.</head>
               <p>BEſides the former objections, they urge the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> of <hi>Bracton,</hi> and <hi>Forteſcue;</hi> to which I anſwer in generall, that the deciſion of this controverſy depends upon Law, and not upon the bare words and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any. The words of Lawyers are to be regarded no further then they are approved by law; for they are but men, &amp; may be incited by paſſion or private intereſt to ſpeak or write what they ought not. I have therfore purpoſely my ſelf omitted all proofs of that nature, and although I could produce a <hi>catalogue</hi> of Lawyers longer then a <hi>Genealogie</hi> to confirm the Kings right, yet I have cited none but ſuch as prove what they ſay by the laws, except only thoſe that are cited by themſelves, which I had alſo omitted, but that I deſire to make it evident how far thoſe Authors are from favouring their ſeditious opinions. And if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty out of a deſire to avoyd the effuſion of blood uſed ſuch gracious expreſſions as were moſt likely to prevail with the people, and conſolidate their minds, they ought not in equity to prejudice the rights of the Crown, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had abdicated therein, ſome part of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:132567:60"/>and granted things deſtructive to his own preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. I have given this generall anſwer, not becauſe his <hi>Majeſty, Bracton,</hi> or <hi>Forteſcue</hi> have affirmed any thing in favour of their right, but to ſhew the inſufficiency of this objection in caſe they had; but the truth is they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly perverted the meaning of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as alſo the meaning of <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Forteſcue:</hi> And although I cannot imagine any man ſo ſenſeleſſe as to believe his <hi>Majeſty</hi> ever ſubſcribed to their judgement; or any that have peruſed the works of <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Forteſcue</hi> ſo voyd of underſtanding as to think they were ever abettors of ſuch phantaſies: yet that they may not exclaime for want of an anſwer I will more particularly examine what they ſay.</p>
               <p>Out of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> anſwer to the nineteen propoſitions they alledge this paſſage. <hi>There being three kinds of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt men, abſolute Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and Democracy, and all theſe having their particular conveniences and inconveniences, the experience and wiſdome of your Anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, hath ſo moulded this out of a mixture of theſe, as to give to this Kingdome (as far as humane prudence can provide) the conveniences of all three, without the inconvenienees of any one, as long as the ballance hangs even between the three eſtates, and they run joyntly on in their proper channell (begetting verdure and fertility, in the meddows on both ſides, and the overflowing of either on either ſide, raiſe no deludge or inundation) the ill of abſolute Monarchy is Tyranny; the ill of Ariſtocracy is fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and diviſion; the ills of Democracy are tumults, violence and licenciouſneſſe. The good of Monarchy is the uniting a nation under own head, to reſiſt invaſion from abroad, and inſurrection at home; The good of Ariſtocracy is the conjunction of Counſell in the ableſt perſons of a State for the publik benefit; The good of Democracy is libertie, and the courage and induſtry which liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie begets—the Lords being trusted with a judicatory power, are an excellent ſcreen and bank between the prince and people—by juſt judgements to preſerve the law, ſince—therefore the power legally placed in both houſes is more then ſufficient to prevent and reſtrain the power of tyranny—ſince to the power of puniſhing,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:132567:60"/>which is already in your hands according to law.</hi> Thus far, and in this manner, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> is cited by the fuller Anſwerer, who that he might the better wreſt his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Speeches to his own purpoſe, hath made many tranſitions from one place to another, mutilating the ſenſe, and leaving out that which ſhould have made his <hi>Majeſties</hi> meaning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. And from theſe words he maketh divers <hi>deductions;</hi> his <hi>firſt deduction</hi> is, that his Majeſty granteth the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> to be mixed in the power it ſelf,<note place="margin">1.

                  </label> This is anſwered in the former chapter: I ſhall here on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire the reader to take notice that his <hi>Majeſties</hi> true and reall intention is ſuch as I have there expounded; for theſe words, <hi>The good of Monarchy is the uniting a Nation under one Head,</hi> are a perfect Comentarie upon the former, and do clearly manifeſt, that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> aſſerted not the Head and Seat of ſupreme power to be a mixed ſubject, but granted a mixture in the adminiſtration of power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>His <hi>ſecond deduction</hi> is that the King granteth the power of interpreting,<note place="margin">2. Deduction.

                  </label> The Lords may have a judicatory power, &amp; be as a bank &amp; Screen between the King and People, without the power of interpretation and giving finall judgment of the ſenſe of Law; It is ſufficient that they have a power to interpret Law <hi>judicially</hi> in ſuch caſes as are cogniſcible in the court, although they have no power to interpret it <hi>authoritively,</hi> which is a prerogative belonging to the King, calling his Judges unto him. But the beſt of all is, that he inferreth from the words above ſaid, <hi>both</hi> the Houſes to have a power
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:132567:61"/>of declaring law, for whereas his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in the premiſſes ſpeaks onely of the Houſe of Lords, by a trick of more then <hi>Presbiterian Legerdemain</hi> he hath juggled the Houſe of Commons into his inference.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Deduction. </seg>3</label> His <hi>third deduction</hi> is that his Majeſty granteth the two Houſes a power of forcible reſiſtance in caſe they ſhould judge his actions tyrannicall and unjuſt; this he collecteth out of theſe words <hi>ſince—therefore the power legally placed in both Houſes is more then ſufficient to prevent and reſtrain the power of tyranny.</hi> This he ſays cannot be made good unleſſe the Houſes have a power of reſiſtance; for tyranny cannot be otherwiſe reſtrained.</p>
               <p>It is evident that his Majeſty ſpeaks not in this place of a forcible, but of a legall way of reſtraint; <hi>Id poſſit quiſquam quod jure poſſit,</hi> Every man is ſaid to have a power to doe that which he can doe by law, although he may be hindered in the execution of it. His Majeſty grants them not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power of reſtraining tyranny, but let that be taken in which goeth immediately before, and his words will bear no other ſenſe but that they have a power of reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſo far as humane prudence can by lawfull and juſt wayes provide. Neither is forcible reſiſtance a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain means of reſtraining tyranny then other legal wayes leſſe corraſive, if the Houſes had a power of reſiſtance, they are not ſure alwayes to prevaile; it is better therefore to tolerate a miſchiefe then to uſe a remedy which is worſe then the diſeaſe, and uncertain too. But they have by law a double power as effectuall as forcible reſiſtance, they may inflict examplary puniſhment upon evil inſtruments, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by others may be affraid to take upon them ſuch imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and they may refuſe to give the King ſubſidies and other neceſſary aſſiſtance, if he refuſeth to moderate his exceſſes. If a tyrant and his evill inſtruments be ſtrong and in no neceſſity, were it lawfull to reſiſt, and to levy war againſt them, the ſucceſſe would be doubtfull, the dammage certain; and if the beſt happen, they ſhould but cure the Common-wealth of an <hi>Ague</hi> by giving it the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:132567:61"/>
                  <hi>Plague:</hi> But if he be neceſſitated either by inſurrections, or otherwiſe, to crave the aſſiſtance of his Subjects, they ſhall then have liberty to execute their power upon his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil inſtruments, or to make uſe of any other means the law hath put into their hands. Where Tyranny reigns ſuch opportunities will in a ſhort time aſſuredly be offered; the beſt Princes cannot always ſuppreſſe rebellions by the help of their loyal Subjects, how much leſſe can Tyrants be able to do it without them. Such Exigencies being conſidered, I ſay the power legally placed in the Houſes is more then ſufficient to reſtrain Tyranny, without a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of reſiſtance.</p>

                  </label> Some think that <hi>Bracton</hi> ſpeaketh not this himſelf, but ſuppoſeth only that ſome might make ſuch an Objection; for theſe words, <hi>Sed dicere poterit quis,</hi> which go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before, ſeem to agree with that interpretation, and to be appliable to that which is here cited, and to all that followeth in the ſame Section. But becauſe the words may alſo admit of another conſtruction, and becauſe I deſire to ſatisfie the Reader in every regard, I will a little more ſtrictly inquire into the ſenſe and meaning of them, and ſhew the inſufficiency and weakneſſe of this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if they could be proved to be his own; for it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that theſe words cannot relate to any coercive power, or civil juriſdiction the Earls and Barons have over the Perſon of the King, but to a directive power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which their Counſells ought to have over him in governing of the people. For as both<note n="a" place="margin">Aquin. 2. Queſt. 96. art. 5.</note> Divines and<note n="b" place="margin">Cabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do part. 2. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſ. 78. Num. 1.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:132567:62"/>the extent of his juriſdiction, and force him to obey it, this is a Legal power and ſuperiority, which none but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates have over their Subjects: or <hi>per poteſtatem directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam,</hi> in reſpect of a directive power he hath over him, by which he ought in Conſcience to be ruled, although he cannot by legal proceſs be forced to obedience; this is a moral power or ſuperiority, which Subjects may have over their Magiſtrates: for in this regard Maſters are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to their Scholars, Counſellours ſuperiour to thoſe that are guided by their Counſells, and the Laws ſuperior to the Law-Makers. <hi>Bractons</hi> ſcope in this place (if theſe words be ſpoken poſitively by himſelf, and not as a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Objection) can be nothing elſe but to aſſert the Earls and Barons in his Court to be Superiour to the King <hi>per poteſtatem directivam,</hi> in reſpect of the directive power their Counſels ought to have over him, which although they be no legal commands, and cannot therefore civilly obleige him to obedience, yet they do morally obleige his Conſcience, when he is convinced that they are juſt and neceſſary for the government of the Kingdome. Theſe words cannot in any other ſenſe be reconciled to that which he ſaith in other places, who when he ſpeaketh of this Subject, doth every where reſolve the contrary; if the Earls and Barons ſhould be interpreted here to be his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors in reſpect of a coercive power, &amp; civil juriſdiction, whereof the places above mentioned are ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; to which I could yet add more, if I thought it needful. But it would be ſuperfluous to illuſtrate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this place by other, when the words conſidered by themſelves imply no more: for he maketh no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Superiority, but calleth God, and the Law, and the Earls and Barons in his court, ſuperiour to the King after the ſame manner. Now it is evident that God in this place is ſaid to be ſuperiour to him, in reſpect of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective power his Law hath over him; for although God hath <hi>de jure</hi> a coercive power and juriſdiction over Kings, and ſhall <hi>de facto</hi> after their death diſpoſe of them as their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:132567:62"/>Judge, and in this life alſo doth often reſtrain them by his ſecret judgements, yet <hi>Bracton</hi> ſpeaketh not in this place (as will appear immediately when the whole and intire period ſhall be cited) of either of thoſe kinds of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but of giving preſent and open judgement upon the Kings fact and upon his charter, which is a juriſdiction that he exerciſeth not, but giveth his Law only for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by which all Princes ought to be regulated, both in granting their charters, and in the whole adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their power. It is alſo clear that the Laws of the Land are ſaid to be ſuperiour to him, in reſpect of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective power of them, having otherwiſe no force or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon him: <hi>Bracton</hi> therefore meaneth that the Earls and Barons in his Court are ſuperiour to him in the ſame reſpect, and not in reſpect of any juriſdiction they ought to exerciſe over him. But if we look upon the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of theſe words, and their dependence upon the precedent and ſubſequent matter. <hi>Bracton</hi>'s intention will more fully and eaſily be diſcerned; I will therefore ſet down as much as is neceſſary to the preſent purpoſe, and explain every clauſe of it, and ſhew the relation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion one thing hath with another, and let the Reader judge whether this teſtimony of <hi>Bracton</hi> doth not ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Kings cauſe, and might not rather be alledged for him then againſt him. <hi>Nec factum Regis nec chartam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt quis judicare, ita quod factum Domini Regis irritetur. Sed dicere poterit quis quod Rex Juſtitiam fecerit, &amp; bene, &amp; ſi hoc, eadem ratione quod male, &amp; ita imponere ei quod injuriam emendet, ne incidat Rex &amp; juſticiari in judicium viventis Dei propter injuriam, Rex autem habet ſuperiorem Deum. Item legem per quam factus eſt Rex, item curiam ſuam, videlicet Comites &amp; Barones, quia Comites dicuntur quaſi ſocii Regis, &amp; qui habet ſocium habet Magiſtrum, &amp; ideo ſi Rex fuerit ſine frano. i. e. ſine lege, debent ei fraenum ponere.</hi> That is: <hi>No man may judge of the Kings fact or his charter, ſo as to make void the fact of our Lord the King. But ſome may ſay the King hath done juſtice and well, and if ſo, by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:132567:63"/>that he hath done ill, and impoſe upon him to amend the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, leſt he and his juſtices fall into the judgement of the living God for the injury. But the King hath God his ſuperiour, and the Law, by which he is made King, and his Court, namely his Earls and Barons, for they are called</hi> Comites, <hi>as being Companions to the King, and he that hath a Companion hath a Maſter, and therefore if the King be without a bridle, that is, without Law, they ought to put a bridle upon him.</hi> If this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage be well conſidered, it will be clear that <hi>Bracton</hi> in the words alleadged, calleth not the Earls and Barons ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the King in a civill and legall, but in a moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard alone.</p>
               <p>Firſt he ſaith: <hi>No man may judge of the Kings fact, or his charter, ſo as to make void the fact of our Lord the King.</hi> How can the words alledged agree with this, if their expoſition be admitted? How can the Earls and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons in his Court be ſuperiour to the King, in reſpect of a coercive power or civil Juriſdiction; when they cannot judge his charter or his fact? No man can have a coercive power or civil juriſdiction over another, but he hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to judge him according to Law, and to force the execution of his Sentence.</p>
               <p>Secondly he ſaith: <hi>But ſome may ſay the King hath done Juſtice, and well, and if ſo, by the ſame reaſon that he hath done ill, and impoſe upon him to amend the injury, leſt he and his Juſtices fall into the hands of the living God for the injury. But the King hath God his ſuperiour, and the Law by which he is made King, and his Court, namely his Earls and Barons.</hi> Having declared what power the Earls and Barons have not over the King, here he declareth what power they have. In caſe juſtice be not duly adminiſtred there are ſome, he ſaith, which may advertiſe him of it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon him to reform what is amiſſe; and thoſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be the Earls and Barons in his Court, who, as well as God, and the Laws of the Realm are ſuperiour to him; that is, are ſuperiour to him in the ſame manner, namely, by a directive power. For he ſaith, not that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:132567:63"/>they ſhould by conſtraint, but by admonition impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to amend the injury, uſing this reaſon, <hi>leſt He and his Juſtices fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> according to that which he ſaith in the place before quoted,<note place="margin">Cap. 4. p. 37.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, he ſaith: <hi>For they are called</hi> Comites, <hi>as being Companions of the King, and he that hath a Companion, hath a Maſter.</hi> Here he giveth a reaſon why the Earls and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons may be called his Superiours, namely, <hi>becauſe they are his Companions, and he that hath a Companion, hath a Maſter.</hi> This reaſon holds good if he indevoureth by it, to prove them his Superiours in reſpect of a directive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and moral ſuperiority, but is ridiculous if he ſhould indevour by it, to prove them his Superiours in reſpect of a coercive power or civil juriſdiction; for every one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Superiour to his Companions, in reſpect of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and be a leige Lord, or Legal Maſter, over all the reſt: But every one may inſtruct Counſell and direct all his Companions, and be a moral Maſter over them; in that reſpect all Companions may be mutually one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Maſters.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he ſaith: <hi>And therefore if the King be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bridle, that is, without Law, they ought to put a bridle upon him.</hi> This inference which he maketh out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words doth alſo confirm that <hi>Bracton</hi> calleth them not his Superiours, in reſpect of a coercive power, or civil juriſdiction; for becauſe they are his Companions, and ſo in a moral regard his Maſters, they ought therefore, he ſaith, <hi>if he be without a bridle, to put a bridle of the Law upon him;</hi> This bridle then muſt be a bridle of Law, and not a bridle of their own ordinances; not a bridle of force, but a bridle of admonitions, counſel and advice; they have no other means but ſuch by Law to bridle the King, if at any time he breaks out into violent and illegal cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. This is the Scope of <hi>Bracton</hi> as is evident by the whole coherence and connexion of the matter; who was ſo far from allowing ſuch fond conceits and imaginations as they
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:132567:64"/>ſeem to ſuppoſe, that the contrary runs in one conſtant veine through all his book: if they regarded the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Bracton,</hi> they would ſoon lay down their arms, and ſue to his Majeſty for a Pardon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they alledge the teſtimony of <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> who ſpeaking of the King of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fol. 25.</note> ſaith: <hi>Prinipatu ne dum Regali ſed &amp; Politico ſuo populo dominatur.</hi> That is, <hi>He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth his People not only by Kingly, but alſo by Politique power.</hi>

                  </label> For matter of fact, it was themſelves that withheld De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents from a legall tryall, the King detained none; but when divers Members of the Parliament were aſſaulted in the ſtreets, driven from the houſe, defamed by Libells, and Juſtice not permitted to take place, it was the office of the King to protect them in their Rights and Liberties, and to force the due execution of the Lawes: and if he refuſed to yield up thoſe to their injuſtice which aſſiſted him, this was not to keep Delinquents from their tryall, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his loyall ſubjects according to law; this for matter of fact. But for matter of Right, ſuppoſe the King had taken up arms unjuſtly, the Law doth not permit his Courts to oppoſe him, or to call any in queſtion that are aſſiſtant to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:132567:66"/>him: when the King taketh up arms they which attend upon his Perſon, or are imployed in other places about the ſame ſervice, may not be moleſted or troubled by proceſſe of Law, either in Parliament, or in any of his Courts, as is declared and enacted by a Statute made the eleventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh.</p>

But they muſt proceed no further, nor after any other manner then the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in Law: And firſt, although the Kings bare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be not ſufficient to warrant his Tenant or others to reſiſt the ſentence of his Courts, yet if the King in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon taketh up arms and granteth Commiſſions to any to aſſiſt him, his Courts muſt then forbear all proceſſe of Law, and deſiſt from all further oppoſition, as is provided in the foreſaid ſtatute. And ſecondly, although the King doth not authorize the fact in perſon, or by Commiſſion, yet neither the two Houſes in Parliament, nor the Judges can make what Ordinances they pleaſe to raiſe arms, or imploy their own inſtruments to bring in Delinquents, but muſt proceed according to order of Law, and commit the whole carriage of the buſineſſe to ſuch of the Kings Officers as are appointed for that purpoſe, which are chiefly the high <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of Counties, who are alſo confined by Law, and may not exceed their Commiſſion. For both in the caſe put by the <hi>reverent Divines,</hi> and alſo in all caſes whatſoever, if Delinquents grow ſo ſtrong that they be able to reſiſt the <hi>poſſe Commitatus,</hi> and cannot be ſuppreſſed but by a War, and by the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, the <hi>Sheriffe</hi> ought then to certifie the Court thereof, and the

               <p>Yet let that alſo be given them, the Oath binds him to protect and corroborate only <hi>juſt Lawes</hi> not all which they ſhall ſay are <hi>juſt;</hi> for it is evident whether <hi>Elegerit</hi> be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the <hi>preter perfect tenſe,</hi> or in the <hi>future tenſe,</hi> that by <hi>juſtas leges &amp; conſuetudines,</hi> it is implied, that he is not bound to protect and corroborate all Laws and Cuſtomes, but only thoſe which are <hi>juſt;</hi> whereof he himſelf aſſiſted by his Juſtices and Council at Law, who ought to inform him were he wanteth information, is to be the Judge.</p>
               <p>To conclude, let the word <hi>Elegerit</hi> and all the other words ſignifie what they pleaſe, it is not much important to their cauſe, for the ſaid Latin Form was never uſed to be taken. In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the Kings Oath contained only theſe three things:<note place="margin">

Now if they could ſhew (which I believe they cannot) that divers Kings have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Latin Form they ſpeak of, yet that is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove a Cuſtome, ſeeing the practiſe was formerly, and is at the preſent otherwiſe.</p>

                  </label> If I ſhould give a particular Anſwer to all their <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> I ſhould weary the Reader with ſuch impertinencies; ſometimes they alledge a ſeditious ſpeech of ſome of the Members for an Act of Parliament; ſometimes they ſay ſuch or ſuch a thing was done by Act of Parliament, and and cite an <hi>Authour</hi> in the margin, whereas no ſuch thing is to be found in the ſaid <hi>Authour;</hi> Sometimes they urge a <hi>Preſident</hi> wherein the Houſes denied to give the King ſuch ſubſidies and aſſiſtance, as he required to his wars, becauſe the ſaid wars were undertaken without their aſſent, and conclude from thence that the power of making war and treating with forain ſtates belong to the two Houſes, when the reaſon of their deniall was the miſcarriages of the war, and the miſ-imployment of former ſubſidies, not that they challenged the power of making war or treating with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain ſtates to pertain unto them. They thought it would have been more convenient for the better carrying on of the war at that time, if the King had undertaken and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged it, by their advice and aſſent, but claimed no right in the ſaid power. But ſuppoſing all that they ſay true, and all their <hi>Preſidents</hi> pertinent, I ſhall make theſe two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Anſwers; firſt, I ſay, that if the King, as in conſcience he was bound, did at the requeſt of the Houſes diſcharge divers corrupt Officers, and ſubſtitute others into their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or if upon juſt reaſons and motives in the vacancy of an office he diſpoſed of it by the aſſent and approbation of the two Houſes, or ordered his war by their advice and direction, or if the two Houſes had challenged ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as is pretended, this doth not argue them to have a right in the Election of the ſaid Officers, or that the carriage and conduct of the war depended upon their aſſent: it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:132567:69"/>might be in the King, a free and voluntary Act of grace not an obligation of law: or he might doe it out of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que reſpects to have their concurrence in ſome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for although He cannot be forced by law to grant all their deſires, yet in wiſdome, policy, and conſcience He ought to yeild unto them when their deſires are juſt, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and Prudentiall; it hath ever been dammageable to the King and for the moſt part to the Kingdome alſo, when differences between himſelf and his two Houſes have not been fairely appeaſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay that if they were able to alledge an act of Parliament wherein ſuch a Right were placed in them, ſuch acts by the common Law of the Land were voyd, for the Rights of the Crown are ſettled upon it by the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Lawes, as hath been ſhewed, and cannot be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Act of Parliament. Theſe are all the Objections which could without violence be referred to this place; The reſt which depend not upon Law ſhall be anſwered in the other Queſtions, if any thing be omitted that ſeemeth to juſtify their cauſe, let any man undertake to anſwer me, and give me notice of it, and I doubt not but I ſhall be able, through the aſſiſtance of God, to make a full and ſatisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory reply unto him. And this I ſhall deſire of my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that when he maketh uſe of any authority he would cite the words at large, as I my ſelf have done in all mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall points, and not make references onely in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that the Reader may judge of the ſcope and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, and be able to diſcern which of us dealeth faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and which of us ingaged by faction ſtrive to elude the Lawes, and wreſt them from their genuine and native ſence.</p>
               <p>And thus by the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, I have in part diſcharged my Conſcience, being bound by all the bonds both of divine and humane lawes to oppoſe and withſtand, as far as I am able, the falſe doctrine, and principles, which <hi>Wolves</hi> in <hi>Sheeps Clothing</hi> indeavour dayly to infuſe into mens minds. I ſhall eaſily avoyd, I preſume, the uſuall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:132567:69"/>calumny incident to thoſe which write upon this Subject, as namely, that under the pretext of promoting the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les doctrine of obedience, they intend by flattering Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to promote their own private intereſt. I would to God the condition of his Majeſty and the Kingdome were ſuch as they might have ſome colur to lay that imputation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. But I am not ignorant that I might ſoone have advanced my own intereſt by adoring the <hi>pretended Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> who diſpoſe of all mens eſtates and fortunes at their pleaſure, pretending as much right to all his Majeſties Kingdomes, and to all the power and glory thereof, as the <hi>Divell</hi> did to all the Kingdomes of the world. <hi>For that,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 4.6.</note> ſay the Members, <hi>is delivered unto us, and to whomſoever we will, we give it,</hi> And I know they uſe to diſtribute their favours liberally to thoſe that will <hi>fall down and worſhip them.</hi> But how poor ſoever my condition is, I have no inclination to buy my intereſt at ſo dear a rate; I had rather periſh in the performance of my duty then be confederate to their Sacriledge, and other Impieties, or not render my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that ſervice which I owe it, for whoſe liberty I would willingly Sacrifice not onely my own intereſt but my Life. I ſhould be no good <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> if I did not deſire a better ſubject to diſcourſe upon then the miſeries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and if by being ſilent and turning a way mine eyes, I could help to quench the Flame that audacious and fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Spirits have kindled in it, I ſhould have abſtained from writing at this time: But the Danger and miſerable condition thereof calls for action to all thoſe, which had not rather ſee all things managed according to the appetit of thoſe <hi>Incendianies</hi> and <hi>Firebrands of the Common-wealth,</hi> then hazard themſelves and their own intereſt for the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdome. I could wiſh that all whom it concerns would ſeriouſly conſider, that the <hi>Fat</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> of the the Land was the Patrimony and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of their <hi>Anceſtours,</hi> and may be of their <hi>Poſterity,</hi> if their own feares and negligence gives it not their enemies. I could wiſh alſo that the pretended Parliamentarians
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:132567:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>would ſeriouſly conſider their own condition, whom I eſteem of all men moſt miſerable: To ſpeak my <hi>deſires,</hi> I wiſh unfainedly the Salvation of them all; but to ſpeak my <hi>thougths,</hi> I conceive more hopes of the honeſt <hi>Heathen,</hi> then of any man that ſhall dye a <hi>Rebell,</hi> or not make <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of all that he hath gained by oppreſſion and injuſtice.</p>
